J	17449126	Article		Surveying cereal-infecting geminiviruses in Germany - Diagnostics and direct sequencing using rolling circle amplification		Schubert, Joerg; Habekuss, Antje; Kazmaier, Katja; Jeske, Holger (holger.jeske@bio.uni-stuttgart.de)									Virus Research		2007	JUL 2007	127	1	61-70	61	70	English						Geminiviruses have spread in German cereal crops during the last few years. In order to identify and classify them, we have compared conventional techniques (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, polymerase chain reaction, bacterial cloning, and sequencing) with a newly developed method which uses rolling circle amplification (RCA), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), and direct sequencing without a bacterial cloning step. Whereas immunological methods utilising polyclonal antibodies were reliable for detection of geminiviruses, they did not discriminate between different German mastrevirus species, in contrast to RCA/RFLP. Direct sequencing gave high fidelity results with the same quality as conventional cloning and sequencing but with significantly reduced effort and costs. Based on a survey of field-derived cereal samples and on DNA sequences of distinct virus isolates we propose two new mastrevirus species, to be named Barley dwarf virus (BDV), and Oat dwarf virus (ODV) according to sequence differences and host range studies. The results show the applicability of RCA-based techniques for field studies and the possibility of sequencing a geminiviral genome without cloning. This approach will accelerate genomics studies of all viruses with small circular DNA genomes. In addition. RCA proves to be a reliable technique allowing for the detection of new geminivirus species as it does not depend on the knowledge of specific primers. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	17265874	Article		Natural occurrence of Fusarium species, fumonisin production by toxigenic strains, and concentrations of fumonisins B-1 and B-2 in conventional and organic maize grown in Spain		Arino, Agustin (aarino@unizar.es) ; Juan, Teresa; Estopanan, Gloria; Gonzalez-Cabo, Jose F.									Journal of Food Protection		2007	JAN 2007	70	1	151-156	151	156	English						Sixty samples of corn from both conventional and organic farms were tested for internal fungal contamination. Molds were identified to genus, and those belonging to the genus Fusarium were identified to species. Twenty isolates of Fusarium verticillioides were tested with a high-performance liquid chromatography-naphthalene dicarboxaldehyde-fluorescence method for their ability to produce fumonisins B-1 and B-2. The internal fungal infection in organic maize (63.20%) was significantly higher than that in conventional maize (40.27%) (P < 0.05). However, the distribution of fungal genera indicated a significantly higher prevalence of Fusarium in conventional (34.93%) than in organic (18.15%) maize, making Fusarium the predominant fungus in conventional maize. This difference in mold distribution between organic and conventional maize was attributed to the difference in cultivation system. The dominant Fusarium species in both conventional and organic samples was F. verticilloides. There were no significant differences in the ability of 20 selected isolates of F. verticillioides to produce fumonisins on conventional or organic corn. Up to 13.3% of the conventional corn samples contained fumonisins 131 and 132 at mean concentrations of 43 and 22 ng/g, respectively. Organic corn samples had somewhat lower levels of contamination: 35 ng/g fumonisin B-1 and 19 ng/g fumonisin B-2 (P > 0.05). The organic farming system, with well-balanced crop rotation, tillage, and compost fertilization, produced corn that was less likely to be contaminated with Fusarium species, although no significant difference in fumonisin concentrations was found between the two types of contaminated corn.

J		Article		Soil quality attributes of conservation management regimes in a semi-arid region of south western Spain		Munoz, A.; Lopez-Pineiro, A.; Ramirez, M. (mramirez@unex.es)									Soil & Tillage Research		2007	SEP 2007	95	1-2	255-265	255	265	English						Soil quality is essential for plant growth and terrestrial ecosystem maintenance. Although soil properties can be influenced by the agricultural production system, this influence has seldom been studied under semi-arid Mediterranean conditions. We analyzed the effect of the management system on soil physical and chemical parameters and soil microbial communities over three consecutive years under different conventional and conservation management regimes: conventional tillage (CT), direct seeding (DS), direct seeding with a wintercrop cover(DSC), and long-term conservation management after nine consecutive years of direct seeding with winter cover (DSCLT). The study was conducted on a maize (Zea mays L.) crop under irrigation in south western Spain. An improvement of the physical, chemical and biological parameters of the DS and DSC soils with respect to the CT soil was observed after two years management. Soil water content increased around 30% during the three years in the DS and DSC soils; organic C, nitrogen, and aggregate stability increased after the second year; total culturable microorganisms were twice as numerous in DSCLT as in the CT soil; and soil penetration resistance was 50% less in all soils under any of the conservation management regimes. Hence, there was a major improvement in soil quality related to a potential increase of crop yields, and a reduced environmental impact, after short-term as well as after long-term conservation management.

Plant and Soil		2005	AUG 2005	275	1-2	135-146	135	146	English						Field trials were established at three European sites (Denmark, Eastern France, South-West France) of genetically modified maize (Zea mays L.) expressing the CryIAb Bacillus thuringiensis toxin (Bt), the near-isogenic non-Bt cultivar, another conventional maize cultivar and grass. Soil from Denmark was sampled at sowing (May) and harvest (October) over two years (2002, 2003); from E France at harvest 2002, sowing and harvest 2003; and from SW France at sowing and harvest 2003. Samples were analysed for microbial community structure (2003 samples only) by community-level physiological-profiling (CLPP) and phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA), and protozoa and nematodes in all samples. Individual differences within a site resulted from: greater nematode numbers under grass than maize on three occasions; different nematode populations under the conventional maize cultivars once; and two occasions when there was a reduced protozoan population under Bt maize compared to non-Bt maize. Microbial community structure within the sites only varied with grass compared to maize, with one occurrence of CLPP varying between maize cultivars (Bt versus a conventional cultivar). An overall comparison of Bt versus non-Bt maize across all three sites only revealed differences for nematodes, with a smaller population under the Bt maize. Nematode community structure was different at each site and the Bt effect was not confined to specific nematode taxa. The effect of the Bt maize was small and within the normal variation expected in these agricultural systems.	Griffiths, B.

Here, we describe the study-sites, experimental layout and results of agro-economic relevance. Experiments were conducted during 2002-2005 in Denmark (Foulum), northern France (Varois) and the Midi-Pyrenees region of southern France (Narbons). MON810 Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)-varieties expressing the Cry1Ab protein, and a T25 glufosinate-ammonium (Basta) tolerant variety expressing the pat-gene encoding phosphinotrinacetyl-transferase were compared with near-isogenic non-Bt varieties, and conventional maize varieties. At Foulum, the maize was harvested for silage. There were no significant differences in yield between Bt-maize and a near-isogenic non-Bt variety, while a small difference in N-concentration of dry matter was detected in 1 year in a range of a measured quality parameters. Similar yield and quatity were found in ploughed and reduced tillage treatments in all varieties. At Varois, the maize was harvested at ripeness and no significant differences in grain yield between Bt-maize and near-isogenic non-Bt varieties were found. These results were expected, as only Narbons harbours significant corn-borer populations. At Narbons, the number of Sesamia and Ostrinia corn-borer larvae were significantly lower in the Bt-maize than in a near-isogenic non-Bt variety and for Sesamia even less than in conventional, varieties sprayed with pesticides to control corn-borer infestation. Here, Bt-maize produced a higher grain yield and grain size than a near-isogenic non-Bt variety or allowed a significant reduction in pesticide use. Concentrations of Cry1Ab in the Bt-varieties were sufficient to effectively control corn-borer larvae. In soil, Cry1Ab was close to the limit of detection and the protein did not accumulate in the soil year on year. (C) 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Journal of Plant Pathology		2003	March 2003	85	1	9-14	9	14	English	print					Six-hundreds-twelve barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) accessions were tested for resistance to Pyrenophora graminea under natural infection in an organic farm in Lower Saxony, Germany, during 1999-2002. More than 30% of these accessions were observed to be resistant in the field and are listed in this report. Varieties with previously documented 'Vada'- and 'Betzes'- resistance, were observed without infection, but those with 'Lion'-resistance and with 'Thibaut'-resistance were found to be susceptible. Many new sources of resistance from East Asia and also samples with deviating symptoms of sensitivity were found. A small group of accessions was infected artificially with two aggressive isolates of the pathogen (I2, I5) and tested by the sandwich method. This revealed both differences and agreement with the results obtained under natural infection. Accessions BGRC 5592, HOR 333, HOR 11475 and OU J362 showed resistance in all experiments.	Mueller, K.

Food Additives and Contaminants		2002	May, 2002	19	5	470-477	470	477	English	print					Over 200 samples of Polish cereal grain from the 1997 harvest obtained from conventional and ecological farms were tested for the presence of ochratoxin A as well as for contamination by microscopic fungi. Ochratoxin A contamination of rye from ecological farms was over six times more frequent than that from conventional cultivation. The ochratoxin A content in wheat and barley samples from ecological farms was also higher. No wheat sample from conventional farms contained the mycotoxin. In the group of ecological farms, there were differences in the percentage of cereal samples containing ochratoxin A. The ochratoxin A levels ranged from 0.2 to 57 mug kg-1. The mean concentration of ochratoxin A in investigated cereal grain was 5.7 mug kg-1. From samples containing detectable amounts of ochratoxin A, fungi producing ochratoxin A under laboratory conditions were isolated. They were classified as belonging to the species Penicillium cyclopium, P. viridicatum, P. chrysogenum and also Aspergillus alliaceus, A. versicolor, A. glaucus and A. flavus. Penicillium strains-producers of ochratoxin A-were isolated from 93% of the samples; in 7% of samples, only Aspergillus strains producing this mycotoxin were noted. Rye samples mainly from one farm with an ecological type of cultivation and from one conventional farm were contaminated with both Aspergillus and Penicillium mycotoxigenic strains.

J		Article		An efficient method for identification and quantification of genetic modification of local, imported and food products of maize in Saudi Arabia using PCR-based markers and real-time PCR		Al-Swailem, Abdulaziz M. (alswailem@kacst.edu.sa) ; Shehata, Maher M.; Shair, Omar H.; Sabaan, Saeed A.; Al-Anazi, Ibrahim O.; Al-Shammari, Turki A.									Journal of Food Agriculture & Environment		2005	APR 2005	3	2	14-19	14	19	English						In recent years food crops have been engineered to express novel genes which impart new characteristics. The genetically modified corn "Maximizer" is resistant to the European corn borer due to the insertion and expression of the cryIA(b) gene from Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. Kurstaki. It is already widely cultivated in the U.S.A. and may find its way to Europe and Middle East as a component of a variety of food and feedstuffs. According to EU regulations, novel foods and ingredients must be labeled to allow consumers to make informed decisions regarding the foodstuffs they purchase. Analytical methods are thus necessary to show the presence or absence of GMO in raw materials and food, and need to be continuously up-dated. Consequently, the aim of this work has been to develop a qualitative and quantitative PCR method to detect genetically modified maize. We carried out a preliminary laboratory trial using conventional and real-time PCR assays to detect and identify purified extracts from pure samples of four cultivars (obtained from Ministry of Agriculture) and two processed food products (collected from the markets) of maize.The screening of 25 RAPD primers allowed selection of 18 primers, which revealed that the loci tested were polymorphic and the results are reproducible. The different profiles obtained among all samples allowed the grouping into 2 main clusters. Cluster A includes American maize I and froot loops with 0.47-0.51 similarity matrix. Cluster B includes American maize 2, local maize 1 and 2. Cluster B consisted of two subgroups. Subgroup 1 includes American maize 2 and subgroup 2 includes local maize 1 and 2. Only corn flakes were assigned outside of groups, suggesting that, it may be obtained from another cultivar or subjected to highly processing. Quantification methods were optimized through different real-time PCR chemistries. The correlation coefficients between ivr1 and cryIA(b) genes copy numbers ranged from -0.99 to 1.00, respectively, thus enabling calculation of the number of ivr1 copies by performing RTQ-PCR. The No. of copies of the ivr1 and cryIA(b) genes are 1.44x10(6) and 1.93x10(5), respectively. The percentage of cryIA(b) is 3.84% and the rest genes of maize constitutes 96.16%. The detection limit of the method was 0.01%, which is far below the established threshold for accidental presence of genetically modified organisms (GMO). This method is specific, highly sensitive and reliable for both identification and quantification of DNA. Therefore, it is suitable for use in routine GMO analysis. Comparison of the LightCycler system and the well-established conventional PCR revealed no statistically significant differences with respect to sensitivity and reproducibility.From our preliminary results, we can conclude that, conventional PCR method is rapid and suitable for characterization, establishment of taxonomic position and detecting maize materials and products. Real-time PCR method is highly rapid, sensitive and can detect trace amounts of GM-DNA (as low as 0.01 similar to 1%). The assays proved to be suitable for analytical purposes, with excellent limits of detection and quantification. They are also effective in indicating that commercially available maize materials are usually not mixed with GM-maize, but food products may be mixed with GM maize in Saudi Arabia. Our laboratories are continuously working on the development of other new quantitative detection methods of GM-maize. Thus, the method may be applied for control purposes and specific labeling.

J		Article		Early sowing: A system for reduced seedbed preparation in Sweden		Arvidsson, J.; Rydberg, T.; Feiza, V.									Soil and Tillage Research		2000	Jan., 2000	53	2	145-155	145	155	English	print					Conventional seedbed preparation for spring sown crops in Sweden includes 3-4 harrowings followed by sowing, but there is a great interest among farmers to reduce this tillage. Since the soil is normally at field capacity after winter, the conventional system implies a major risk of soil compaction and the farmer has to wait for the soil to dry before seedbed preparation can be started. A new technique that has been made possible by new types of seed drills and improved tyre equipment is early sowing of spring cereals without harrowing. It was tested in 74 field experiments in Sweden during 1992-1996, on soils with clay contents ranging from 6 to 57% (typically Eutric or Gleyic Cambisols). On an average, early sowing increased yield by 1% compared with that of conventional sowing. When early sowing was made more than 30 days before conventional sowing it increased yield by an average of 11%. There was no clear relation between yield response to early sowing and soil type. In four long-term experiments, there were no significant differences in bulk density or in saturated hydraulic conductivity between early and conventional sowing. As an average for all experiments, number of emerged plants was 6% lower for early than that for conventional sowing, but this factor did not seem to be decisive for crop yield. In an experiment, when barley (Hordeum vulgare, L.) was grown after barley, there was a higher occurrence of leaf scald (Rhyncosporium secalis (Sacc.) Shoemaker) and net blotch (Dreschlera teres (Oudem) J.J. Davies) in early sown treatments, however, when all results are considered, the risk of increased plant pests due to early sowing seems small. In total, early sowing of spring cereals without harrowing may be beneficial to farmers since it reduces the cost of tillage and increases crop yield potential by lengthening the growing period.

J		Article		Effect of agricultural land use on soil organic matter status and the composition of earthworm communities in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.		Haynes, R. J. (haynesd@nu.ac.za) ; Dominy, C. S.; Graham, M. H.									Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment		2003	May 2003	95	2-3	453-464	453	464	English	print					Little is known regarding the effects of land use on soil organic matter status and earthworm communities in South African soils. For that reason the effects of the main agricultural land uses in the midlands region of KwaZulu-Natal (maize (Zea mays), sugarcane (Saccharum spp.), annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum), permanent kikuyu pasture (Pennisetum clandestinum), gum (Eucalyptus grandis) and pine forest (Pinus patula)) on soil organic matter content, microbial biomass C and the size and composition of the earthworm community was investigated on two sites where the long-term history of land management was known. In comparison with, undisturbed, native grassland, permanent kikuyu pasture resulted in an increase in organic C, K2SO4-extractable C, microbial biomass C and the microbial quotient. Maize and sugar production under conventional tillage (CT) resulted in a decrease in organic matter and microbial biomass. Under gum and pine forests the organic C content was similar to that of under native grassland but the microbial biomass and microbial quotient tended to be higher. Exotic earthworms dominated under agricultural management making up to 98 and 100% of the communities at sites 1 and 2, respectively. They belonged to the families Lumbricidae, Acanthrodilidae and Megascolicidae. They were accidentally introduced from Europe, India and West Africa, respectively, and now coexist in the sub-humid warm climate of the region. Earthworm numbers (230-310 m-2) and biomass, the number of species present, and the number present as adults were all greatest under kikuyu pastures and numbers were low (<60 m-2) under maize (CT) and sugarcane. Numbers were 3.5-fold higher for maize under zero than CT. In relation to the comparatively large organic C and microbial biomass C values under exotic forests, earthworm numbers were notably low (25-60 m-2). This was attributed to the low palatability of pine and gum litter. It was concluded that land use has substantial effects on soil organic matter content and on the size, composition and diversity of earthworm communities in South African soils.	Haynes, R.

J		Article		Rapid dissipation of atrazine in soils taken from various maize fields		Pussemier, L.; Goux, S.; Vanderheyden, V.; Debongnie, P.; Tresinie, I.; Foucart, G.									Weed Research		1997		37	3	171-179	171	179	English						A laboratory study was carried out in order to measure the degradation rate of atrazine in 36 different soils taken from maize (Zea mays L.) fields in Belgium. These soils differed in their atrazine treatment histories, pH, organic matter content, and type of organic and mineral fertilization. Half-lives of less than 10 days were found in more than 60% of the soils sampled. This rapid dissipation could be linked in a significant way to repeated pretreatments with atrazine (intensive maize cropping) as well as to higher pH values (from neutral to alkaline). A low organic matter content might also be a factor explaining the rapid degradation of atrazine, but to a lesser extent than the first two factors. On the other hand, mineral fertilization was shown to slow ,down atrazine dissipation. It is hypothesized that repeated treatments of atrazine cause a microbial adaptation to atrazine degradation and that acidic soil conditions impede this adaptation. To date, this is the first time that evidence for widespread accelerated degradation of atrazine has been reported.

J		Article		Evaluation of effects of transgenic Bt maize on microarthropods in a European multi-site experiment		Cortet, Jerome (jerome.cortet@ensaia.inpl-nancy.fr) ; Griffiths, Bryan S.; Bohanec, Marko; Demsar, Damjan; Andersen, Mathias N.; Caul, Sandra; Birch, Andrew N. E.; Pernin, Celine; Tabone, Elisabeth; de Vaufleury, Annette; Ke, Xin; Krogh, Paul Henning									Pedobiologia		2007		51	3	207-218	207	218	English						The effects of maize expressing the Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1Ab protein (Bt maize) on soil microarthropods were assessed in the field at four European locations (two in Denmark and two in France) that differ in their climatic conditions or soil properties. Each site was considered as a separate experiment, with separate statistical comparison. Effects of farming practices using Bt maize were compared with conventional farming practices using near-isogenic non-Bt maize and also (at some of the sites) other conventional varieties. Furthermore, at one field site (Foulum, Denmark), the effects of Bt crops were studied in both conventional tillage and reduced tillage contexts. At another field site (Askov, Denmark), Bt maize effects were also compared to the effects of the chemical insecticide dimethoate. Moreover, at three of the field sites (all except Narbons, France), the possibility of a localised Bt effect around the rhizosphere compared to the bulk soil was assessed by sampling within and between maize rows. There were some significant negative effects of Bt maize on microarthropods in soils with a high clay content. Significant differences of the same magnitude also occurred between different conventional varieties of maize, but the effect of dimethoate appeared clearly greater than Bt effects. It is thus debatable if the Bt maize effect is an effect of the Bt toxin or just an effect of the maize variety. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the effect of Bt maize on soil microarthropods was small and within the normal variation expected in conventional agricultural systems.

J		Article		The potential of leys and short rotation coppice hedges as reservoirs for parasitoids of cereal aphids in organic agriculture		Langer, Vibeke									Agriculture Ecosystems and Environment		2001	October, 2001	87	1	81-92	81	92	English	print					The aim of this study was to assess whether leys used for nitrogen fixation and fodder, which cover from a fifth to more than half the acreage on organic farms, as well as short rotation coppice (SRC) used for energy purposes, have potentials as reservoirs for aphid parasitoids in organic agriculture. Exposure of cereal aphids to naturally occurring parasitoids in various crops showed that parasitoids capable of parasitizing the pest aphid Sitobion avenae were active in ley, alfalfa and SRC from spring to late autumn, but in barley fields only in mid-summer. Parasitism by Aphidius sp. dominated in ley, whereas parasitism by Praon sp. was most frequent in SRC. Alternative aphid hosts for parasitoids of S. avenae were shown to be present in late summer, late autumn and early spring in ley and SRC. Within field distribution of parasitism and prevalence of entomophtoralean fungi on aphids in spring barley fields were determined by spatially explicit sampling, but was not consistently affected by proximity to ley or SRC. The data indicate that SRC hedges and clover/grass leys in the rotation may increase diversity and activity of parasitoids attacking cereal aphids.

OSU-142 was studied in relation to three levels of N fertilization (0, 40, and 80 kg ha-1) under field conditions in Erzurum, Turkey, in 1999 and 2000. Seed inoculation with A. brasilense Sp246 significantly affected yield and yield components, both in wheat and barley. On average of years and N doses, inoculation with A. brasilense Sp246 increased spike number per m2, grain number per spike, grain yield, and crude protein content by 7.2, 5.9, 14.7, and 4.1% in wheat and by 6.6, 8.1, 17.5, and 5.1% in barley, respectively, as compared to control. Inoculation with Bacillus sp. OSU-142 significantly increased kernel number per spike in wheat, but no significant effect was determined in the other characteristics. Grain yields and yield components were also higher at all levels of nitrogen fertilizer in the inoculated plots as compared to the control. However, these increases diminished at high fertilizer levels. These results suggest that application of the growth promoting bacteria A. brasilense Sp246 may have the potential to be used as a biofertilizer for spring wheat and barley cultivation in organic and low-N input agriculture.

J		Article		Long-term tillage system effects under moist cool conditions in Switzerland		Anken, Thomas (thomas.anken@fat.admin.ch) ; Weisskopf, Peter; Zihlmann, Urs; Forrer, Hansrudolf; Jansa, Jan; Perhacova, Katarina									Soil & Tillage Research		2004	August 2004	78	2	171-183	171	183	English	print					How do different soil tillage systems influence soil quality over the years? Under moist cool conditions is it possible in the long term to reduce dramatically soil tillage intensity without experiencing reductions in yield or other problems? In 1987, the Swiss Federal Research Station for Agricultural Economics and Engineering in Tanikon initiated a long-term soil tillage trial to clarify these questions. The trial compared mouldboard plough, chisel, paraplow, shallow tillage and no-tillage systems on a well-drained Orthic Luvisol with 160 g kg-1 clay, 310 g kg-1 silt, and under a climate that has a mean annual precipitation of 1180 mm. The tillage treatment effects were evaluated by measuring several biological, chemical, and physical soil quality indicators. Reduced soil tillage increased earthworm populations, reduced Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides infection in wheat (Triticum aestivum) and increased plant colonisation by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Yields for no-tillage and other ploughless cultivation techniques were on par with those obtained by ploughing. An exception was direct-drilled maize (Zea mays), where no-tillage decreased yield by more than 10% over the course of 14 years. In the first 7 years of the trial, the level of soil organic carbon in all the tillage regimes was approximately 40% lower than natural grassland (initial situation 1987 = 75 Mg SOC ha-1). The no-tillage method did not differ from the others in respect of bulk density, but it showed an increased preconsolidation stress and hence better trafficability. Under Switzerland's moist cool climatic conditions, it is possible to reduce soil tillage intensity without substantial reductions in yield, and at the same time improve soil quality.

J		Article		Sulphur mineralisation in five Danish soils as measured by plant uptake in a pot experiment		Eriksen, Jorgen; Mortensen, Jorgen V.; Nielsen, Jorgen Dissing; Nielsen, Niels Erik									Agriculture Ecosystems and Environment		1995		56	1	43-51	43	51	English						Reductions in atmospheric S deposition have created S deficiency in some agricultural soils. In such soils the release of S from organic matter may be important for the supply of S to plants. In this study net mineralisation of S was measured during two successive growth seasons as S removed by plant material and leachates. Pots were subjected to natural conditions and cropped with either Italian rye grass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) both years or spring oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) followed by spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Sulphur was the limiting factor for dry matter yield in the pots. Sulphur concentrations in Italian rye grass, rape and barley varied from 0.055 to 0.21, 0.06 to 0.078 and 0.07 to 0.17%, respectively. Net mineralisation was 3.3-6.7 mu-g S per g soil year-1 (1.7 to 3.1% of total organic S), and could not prevent S deficiency in the crops; differences among soils developed early in the experiment. Net mineralisation of S was not significantly correlated with total organic S, C-bonded S or sulphate-ester S content of the soils but with microbial activity in the soils (r=0.90). Net mineralisation was significantly affected by the type of cropping system but differences between systems were small compared to differences in net mineralisation among soils. It may be concluded that reductions in atmospheric deposition of S must, at least partly, be replaced by S fertilisation to maintain crop yield and quality.	Eriksen, Jorgen; Dan. Inst.

Agriculture Ecosystems and Environment		2001	March, 2001	84	1	1-20	1	20	English	print					Over 120,000 non-native species of plants, animals and microbes have invaded the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, India, and Brazil, and many have caused major economic losses in agriculture and forestry as well as negatively impacting ecological integrity. Some introduced species, like corn (Zea mays L.), wheat (Triticum spp.), rice (Oryza sativa L.), plantation forests, domestic chicken (Gallus spp.), cattle (Bos taurus), and others, are beneficial and provide more than 98% of the world's food supply. Precise economic costs associated with some of the most ecologically damaging alien species are not available. Cats (Felis cattus) and pigs (Sus scrofa), for example, are responsible for the extinction of various animal species, however, it is impossible to assign monetary values to species forced to extinction. The estimate is that non-native species invasions in the six nations are causing more than USdollar sign 314 billion per year in damages.

Soil & Tillage Research		2006	NOV 2006	90	1-2	84-92	84	92	English						Intensive conventional farming and continuous use of land resources can lead to agro-ecosystem decline and increased releases Of CO2 to the atmosphere as soil organic matter (OM) decays. The aim of this research was to evaluate the influence of varying types and depths of tillage on microbial biomass, C content, and humification in the Profile of a loamy-sandy soil in the Mugello valley, close to the Apennine Mountains, in Italy. Soil samples were collected to depths of 0-10, 10-20, 20-30 and 30-40 cm, in the ninth year following introduction of tillage practices. Highest content of all C forms examined (total, extractable and humified) was found at the 0-10 cm depth with minimum tillage (MT) and ripper subsoiling (RS) and at the 30-40 cm depth with conventional tillage (CT). Humified C decreased with depth in soils under MT and RS. None of the tillage systems showed any difference in total N and microbial biomass C in the upper depths, but concentrations were greater below 20 cm in soils subjected to CT, than other tillage systems. Crop production was similar in all tillage systems. Stratification and redistribution of nutrients were consistent with the well known effects of tillage reduction. Total organic C and its distribution in the profile depended on the tillage system employed. MT and RS can be regarded as excellent conservation tillage systems, because they also sequester C.

J		Article		In vivo silage feeding value of early maize hybrids registered in France between 1958 and 1994		Barriere, Yves; Argillier, Odile									Euphytica		1998		99	3	175-182	175	182	English	print					The in vivo feeding value of 118 early maize (Zea mays L) hybrids, registered in France between 1958 and 1994, has been estimated from digestibility measurements with sheep at INRA Lusignan (France). There were great variations in the digestibilities of organic matter and crude fibre, and in the energy value of these hybrids, ranging respectively between 65.1 and 73.5%, 45.4 and 60.0%, and 0.79 and 0.95 UFL. There was a regular decrease in the average feeding value, regarding the year of registration, for each of the feeding value traits investigated. From 1958 to date, the frequency of hybrids lower than Mammouth increased, while the number of hybrids higher than LG11 or Brutus clearly decreased. Across the years, the increase in variations among hybrids occurred because of the introduction of hybrids with a poorer feeding value, particularly since the end of the 80's. The extremely efficient genetic pressure in breeding for whole plant yield and stalk standability could explain the drift in feeding value. A silage maize hybrid with a high yield, a high lodging resistance, and a good feeding value can be available only if breeders use a digestibility assessment, proved as representative of the digestion in cattle. In addition to a digestibility evaluation, the prediction of maize ingestibility could be taken into account as soon as a criterion is established.

J		Article		Susceptibility of German spring barley cultivars to loose smut populations from different European origins		Mueller, Karl-Josef (k-j.mueller@darzau.de)									European Journal of Plant Pathology		2006	OCT 2006	116	2	145-153	145	153	English						Forty-two registered spring barley cultivars from the German official list were tested under natural infection conditions for susceptibility to loose smut (Ustilago tritici f.sp. hordei) during two test cycles at two locations. Only cv. Steffi was found to be resistant to the local loose smut population. Cultivar Sigrid showed lowest susceptibility because of flowering inside the leaf sheath. Less than 1% infection at all sites showed up in cvs Auriga, Jacinta and Hendrix. Twenty-one cultivars had an infection rate of less than 2%. Cultivar Danuta displayed the highest susceptibility with an average of 12.6%. Another 23 spring barley accessions with expected loose smut resistance were inoculated artificially with loose smut populations obtained from 11 locations in Germany and neighbouring countries. Only Jet with the resistance Un3/6, CDC Freedom with Un8, CIho9973 with quantitative resistance, as well as Lino and GangTuoQuingKeHao1 remained disease-free. In addition to these, another eight accessions in this test group are recommended to become part of a differential tester set to distinguish origins of loose smut. Statistical analysis showed that for scoring of cultivars more importance has to be given to the number of locations for infestation than to the number of test locations to determine the degree of attack. In view of the existing inspection limits for production of certified seed in European countries, the currently registered German barley cultivars put organic seed producers and breeders at high risk in respect to loose smut infection, if the number of generations for multiplication under organic farming increases.

The aim of the present study was to compare the quality composition of transgenic wheat (Triticum durum L.), corn (Zea mays L.), and tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum Mill.) to the nontransgenic control with a similar genetic background. In the first experiment, Ofanto wheat cultivar containing the tobacco rab1 gene and nontransgenic Ofanto were used. The second experiment compared two transgenic lines of corn containing Bacillus thuringiensis "Cry toxin" gene (PR33P67 and Pegaso Bt) to their nontransgenic forms. The third experiment was conducted on transgenic tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum Mill.) containing the Agrobacterium rhizogenes rolD gene and its nontransgenic control (cv. Tondino). Conventional and genetically modified crops were compared in terms of fatty acids content, unsaponifiable fraction of antioxidants, total phenols, polyphenols, carotenoids, vitamin C, total antioxidnt activity, and mineral composition. No significant differences were observed for qualitative traits analyzed in wheat and corn samples. In tomato samples, the total antioxidant activity (TAA), measured by FRAP assay, and the naringenin content showed a lower value in genetically modified organism (GMO) samples (0.35 mmol of Fe2+ 100 g(-1) and 2.82 mg 100 g(-1), respectively), in comparison to its nontransgenic control (0.41 mmol of Fe2+ 100 g(-1) and 4.17 mg 100 g(-1), respectively). On the basis of the principle of substantial equivalence, as articulated by the World Health Organization, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, these data support the conclusion that GM events are nutritionally similar to conventional varieties of wheat, corn, and tomato on the market today.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the contents of trichothecenes in representative samples of oats during official variety, nitrogen fertilization and organic farming trials in Finland, 1997-1999. Further objectives were to promote industry and commerce by selection of high-quality oat varieties for various applications. The official variety trials conducted at 8-10 locations were managed following standard protocol. There were 2 types of agronomy trial, the first included comparison of oat cultivars grown in conventional and organic farming systems at 6 locations, and the second used 5 nitrogen rates (0, 40, 80, 120 and 160 kg N ha-1) at 2 locations. Regardless of wet cold summer occurring in Finland during 1998, the concentrations of Fusarium toxins were lowest during this 3 year monitoring period. More mycotoxins were produced during the warm, dry summers of 1997 and 1999 than in 1998. In all, 55% of the oat samples in the official variety trials contained deoxynivalenol (DON) within the range of 50896 mug kg-1. The differences in DON concentrations between organic and conventional cultivation were small. The results showed also that the use of various nitrogen fertilization levels only slightly affected the trichothecene concentrations. The contents of trichothecenes in Finnish grains appeared to be similar to or lower than those reported earlier in the Northern Hemisphere.

Plant and Soil		2003	October 2003	256	2	315-324	315	324	English	print					The South Tyrol, the main apple-growing area in Italy, is characterised by intensive soil cultivation. Previous investigations have revealed the existence of replant disorders although the main causes of these have not been evaluated. A survey was carried out in this area with two main aims: to evaluate the role of soil-borne pathogens in apple replant disease and to compare the impact of organic and conventional management on replant diseases caused by soil-borne pathogens. The experimental sites were chosen to obtain three pairs of contiguous conventional and organic apple orchards. There was a high level of organic matter in both the organic and the conventional apple orchards with no appreciable differences in humic fractions. The soil sickness test with apple seedlings revealed a significant reduction in growth for all soil samples as compared to the peat control. The growth score on soil samples from organic orchards was significantly higher than that obtained on conventional soil. Total fungal population in soil samples was positively correlated to the apple seedlings growth score and negatively correlated to the frequency of root colonisation. Most of the root-colonising pathogens belonged to the well-known root rot complex, Rhizoctonia solani and Pythium spp. being the most pathogenic on apple seedlings.	Manici, L.

J		Article		Coordination and cooperation for Bt maize plantation in Brandenburg - An explorative analysis of co-existence at the farm level	Koordination und Kooperation beim Bt-Maisanbau in Brandenburg - Eine explorative Untersuchung betrieblicher Strategien der Koexistenz	Consmueller, Nicola (nicola.consmueller@agrar.hu-berlin.de) ; Beckmann, Volker; Schleyer, Christian									Berichte ueber Landwirtschaft		2008	OCT 2008	86	2	242-261	242	261	German						In Germany, about 1.7 Mio ha of maize are grown each year and 350 000 ha are affected by the European Corn Borer (ECB; Ostrinia nubilaliS HUBNER), a serious pest in maize production. The ECB can either be controlled mechanically or by the use of pesticides or biological measures. Since 2006, several varieties of transgenic Bt-maize can be grown in Germany. Bt-maize is genetically modified in order to express a toxin from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis, which becomes lethal to the larvae of the ECB when feeding on the plant. The planting of Bt-maize also bears the risk of gene-outcrossing to conventional or organic maize plants. Since co-existence of all production forms is a major aim in the European Union, growing transgenic plants is subject to strict regulations. The regulatory framework in Germany comprises ex-ante regulations and ex-post liability rules to protect conventional and organic fanning from possible negative side effects of transgenic plants. The farmer who grows Bt-maize is for instance obliged to keep buffer zones and is held liable for damages.The value of Bt-maize production also depends on additional costs arising from ex-ante regulations and ex-post liability according to the distribution of property rights. These costs could be minimized by cooperation between the Bt-maize growing farmer and his neighbours.Case studies comprising a Bt-maize farmer and two of his direct neighbours were carried Out to elucidate the effect of transaction costs on the decision to grow Bt-maize. For the Study, the Oder-bruch region in the federal state of Brandenburg was chosen since in this area much Bt-maize is grown and the ECB is of increasing importance.The case studies revealed that the costs arising from ex-ante regulations and ex-post liability rules were only of minor importance to the Bt-maize growing farmers. The large Farms could easily manage the construction of buffer zones within their own fields and avoid the planting of Bt-maize close to their neighbours. Thus, cooperation was not necessary to achieve co-existence.Still, cooperation could become more important in the future, since there is a possibility of reducing intended buffer zones of 150 m by mutual agreement between the Bt-maize growing farmer and his neighbour(s).

More isolates of B. sorokiniana were obtained from spring barley in the organic farm and Fusarium spp. in the conventional farm. Results of winter wheat health estimation were not clear. In the end of cropping season higher mean disease index for roots was observed in organic farm, and for stem bases the relation was opposite. The main casual agents were Fusarium spp. Their higher occurrence was observed on roots, stem bases and also on grain in the organic farm. Furthermore, organic farm conditions were favourable to Trichoderma spp. development and conventional one to Penicillium spp.	Lukanowski, A.; Baturo, A.; Sadowski, Cz.; Department of Phytopathology, University of Technology and Agriculture, 85-225, Bydgoszcz, Poland	fitopato@atr.bydgoszcz.pl			0	0		0	0	0			Agriculture; Infectious Diseases; Environmental Sciences & Ecology	1212-2580				Agronomy (Agriculture); Infection; Pest Assessment Control and Management	52502, Agronomy - Miscellaneous and mixed crops; 52504, Agronomy - Grain crops; 54600, Pest control: general, pesticides and herbicides	Fungi, Plantae; Fungi, Microorganisms, Nonvascular Plants, Plants; Fungi Imperfecti or Deuteromycetes [15500]; [Bipolaris sorokiniana; (pathogen)] [Fusarium spp.; (pathogen)] [Penicillium spp.] [Trichoderma spp.]/Monocotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Monocots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Gramineae [25305]; [spring barley; (grain crop, host)] [winter wheat; (grain crop, host)]					Poland; Europe; Palearctic region		conventional farming; applied and field techniques/organic farming; applied and field techniques						2022-07-19	BCI:BCI200300416679

FEMS Microbiology Ecology		2008	AUG 2008	65	2	323-338	323	338	English						In this study, we investigated the impact of organic and mineral fertilizers on the community composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and bacteria in the mycorrhizosphere of maize in a field experiment established in 1956, in south-east Sweden. Roots and root-associated soil aggregates were sampled four times during the growing season in 2005, in control plots and in plots amended with calcium nitrate, ammonium sulphate, green manure, farmyard manure or sewage sludge. Fungi in roots were identified by cloning and sequencing, and bacteria in soil aggregates were analysed by terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism, cloning and sequencing. The community composition of AM fungi and bacteria was significantly influenced by the different fertilizers. Changes in microbial community composition were mainly correlated with changes in pH induced by the fertilization regime. However, other factors, including phosphate and soil carbon content, also contributed significantly to these changes. Changes in bacterial community composition and a reduction in bacterial taxon richness throughout the growing season were also manifest. The results of this study highlight the importance and significant effects of the long-term application of different fertilizers on edaphic factors and specific groups of fungi and bacteria playing a key role in arable soils.

J		Article		Compost and P amendments for stimulating microorganisms and maize growth in a saline soil from Pakistan in comparison with a nonsaline soil from Germany		Muhammad, Sher; Mueller, Torsten; Joergensen, Rainer Georg (joerge@wiz.uni-kassel.de)									Journal of Plant Nutrition and Soil Science		2007	DEC 2007	170	6	745-751	745	751	English						A 92 d greenhouse pot experiment with maize (Zea mays L.) was carried out with a strongly saline soil from Pakistan (P-s) in comparison with a nonsaline soil from Germany (G-s) similar in pH and texture. The aim was to evaluate salinity effects on the decomposition of compost and effects of compost and P amendments on (1) plant growth and (2) microbial-biomass formation. The yield of maize shoot-C and root-C increased in both soils in the order nonamended control < +triple superphosphate (TSP) (A1) < +compost (A2) < +(compost + TSP) (A3) < +TSP-enriched compost (A4). In comparison with the control, the highest yield in treatment A4 was nearly doubled on the G-s, but was increased more than 8-fold on the saline P-s. Averaging the three compost treatments, 32% of the compost added was decomposed in the German soil and 36% in the Pakistani soil on the basis of the compost recovered as particulate organic matter. These data were roughly in agreement with the CO2-evolution data. This indicates that the decomposition of compost was not affected by salinity. Compost-derived CO2 was mainly evolved until day 32, the root-derived CO2 from day 74 until the end of the experiment. The addition of compost resulted in higher contents of microbial biomass C and biomass P, but also in that of NaHCO3-extractable P. These three properties were significantly interrelated (r = 0.64-0.85), but on a lower level of significance than the relationships between shoot-C, root-C, and NaHCO3-extractable P (r = 0.90-0.93). Applying compost enriched with TSP (incubation of compost and TSP for 24 h) provided considerably more P to plants and microorganisms than the separate addition of these two components. The results suggest that the role of the microbial biomass as a sink and source for available P deserves further attention.

Food Additives and Contaminants		2002	November 2002	19	11	1051-1057	1051	1057	English	print					Over 200 samples of Polish cereal grain from the 1998 harvest obtained from conventional and ecological farms were investigated for the presence of ochratoxin A and for contamination by microscopic fungi. The frequency of contamination of rye and barley grains from conventional and ecological farms was similar in most cases; it varied from nearly 5 to 12%, respectively, for both types of farming. However, in samples from ecological farms, higher maximum concentrations of ochratoxin A were observed (35 mug kg-1, overall range 1.4-35.3 mug kg-1) for both cereals rye and barley in comparison with rye and barley from conventional farms (maximum levels of 8.8 and 9.7 mug kg-1, respectively). However, wheat grain from the conventional farms showed ochratoxin A concentrations in a very wide range from 0.6 to 1024 mug kg-1 and the average frequency of contaminated samples was about 48%. In contrast, in wheat samples from ecological farming, the presence of ochratoxin A ranged from 0.8 to 1.6 mug kg-1 (mean 1.2 mug kg-1) and the frequency of contamination was 23%. From samples containing detectable amounts of ochratoxin A, fungi producing ochratoxin A under laboratory conditions were isolated. They were classified as belonging to the species Penicillium cyclopium, P. viridicatum, Aspergillus ochraceus group, A. glaucus and A. versicolor. Penicillium strains-species known to be producers of ochratoxin A-were isolated from 71% of the samples; in 28% of samples, only Aspergillus strains (species known to be producers of this mycotoxin) were noted. These results have been compared with those obtained in 1997.

J		Article		Modelling organic carbon turnover in cleared temperature forest soils converted to maize cropping by using 13C natural abundance measurements		Arrouays, Dominique; Balesdent, Jerome; Mariotti, Andre; Girardin, Cyril									Plant and Soil		1995		173	2	191-196	191	196	English						In southwest France, thick humic acid loamy soils have developed from Quaternary silty alluvial deposits. On these soils, most forest lands have been converted to continuous intensive maize cropping and the loss of C upon conversion to intensive agriculture has been shown to be significant. The objective of this study was to determine if a study of natural 13C abundance in soil organic C makes possible an improved modelling of organic carbon turnover in the cultivated horizons of soils in this landscape in southwest France. A chronosequence study is realized by comparing C pools and C-13 natural abundance of three forest sites and 14 adjacent agricultural sites, whose ages of cultivation ranged from 3 to 32 yr. delta-13C ratio is found to increase with time of cultivation. The fraction of C coming from the maize crop increases during the first decades of cultivation, and reaches a plateau thereafter. This equilibrium level is reached after a few decades of cultivation. The decrease of the initial C pool is fitted by a simple model assuming that about half of this pool is mineralized during the first yr of cultivation whereas the other half decreases at a slower rate. Therefore, a general bi-compartmental model is proposed for describing the soil organic carbon dynamics in these soils after forest clearing and intensive maize cropping.	Inst. Natl. Rech.

A.; Chantigny, M. H.; Andreux, F.; Arrouays, D.									Soil Biology & Biochemistry		2006	SEP 2006	38	9	2834-2842	2834	2842	English						In southwest France, much of the forested land on sandy spodosols has been converted to continuous maize cropping in the last few decades. To evaluate the impacts of this change on soil organic matter properties, we compared total organic C and neutral and amino sugars content in whole soil and particle size separates of two forested, and five related sites that had been either clear-cut for 12 and 18 mo, or cultivated to maize for 4-22yr. Soil carbohydrates accounted for 4-7% of the total organic C across all sites. Soil organic C contents of clear-cut and cultivated sites were only 57-79% of the average value measured in forested sites. Accordingly, carbohydrate content of clear-cut and cultivated sites were only 35-66% of the value in forested sites. Ordering the sites in a chronosequence indicated that both total organic C and carbohydrate contents decreased with an increase in time elapsed since clear-cutting and maize cultivation. The only exception was a partial recovery of carbohydrate content in the site that had been under continuous maize for 22 yr. The day+silt fraction (0-50 mu m) was enriched in carbohydrates, mainly of microbial origin, whereas the sand size fractions (50-200 and 200-2000 pm) contained fewer carbohydrates which were mainly of plant origin. Monosaccharide analysis of particle size separates revealed significant differences in carbohydrate composition between sites. Relative to forested sites, the coarse and fine sand fractions in clear-cut and cultivated sites were depleted in carbohydrates and were relatively enriched in plant-derived carbohydrates. Carbohydrate content of the day+silt fraction drastically decreased upon clear-cutting. Amino sugar content was consistently lower in clear-cut and cultivated sites than in forested sites, indicating that microbial populations were negatively affected by clear-cutting and cultivation. The fungal population appeared more sensitive than bacteria to these land-use changes as indicated by a greater decline in glucosamine than in muramic acid contents. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The studies were carried out in 1998-2001 on experimental fields in Osiny near Pulawy, south-eastern Poland. In the emergence stage the roots health status was the lowest in organic system however in the end of vegetation season, in dough maturity stage the most disease symptoms were stated in conventional system. The mycological analyses revealed the occurrence of two important pathogens: Bipolaris sorokiniana and Fusarium spp. Despite of root healthiness macroscopic analyses showed their lower health status in organic system only in emergence stage and the most quantity of plants with disease symptoms in dough maturity stage were observed in conventional system, but pathogens like Bipolaris sorokiniana and Fusarium spp. were mostly isolated in organic system in both phases. It can suggest that disease symptoms in conventional system can be caused by different than fungus factors. The lowest percent of mentioned pathogens was stated in integrated system. It is worth to notice that organic conditions could be favourable to Gliocladium roseum. Because of growing interest in ecology, giving up of using pesticides and more and more popular biological disease control, these fungi of Gliocladium genus be used in this system due to their antagonistic properties.

J		Article		Ploughing effects on soil organic matter after twenty years of conservation tillage in Lower Saxony, Germany		Stockfisch, N.; Forstreuter, T.; Ehlers, W.									Soil and Tillage Research		1999	Sept., 1999	52	1-2	91-101	91	101	English	print					Conservation tillage may concentrate organic matter and carbon in the soil, thus improving soil quality and counteracting CO2-increase in the atmosphere. In parts of Germany however, continuous conservation tillage can cause problems in soil and crop management, resulting in a need to shift to short-term conventional tillage, such as mouldboard ploughing. The objective of the present research was to follow the fate of soil organic matter, when soil is ploughed after long-term minimum tillage in the temperate climate of Lower Saxony. In minimum tillage, shallow cultivation was restricted to stubble cleaning and seedbed preparation, using a rotary harrow or rototiller. After 20 years of shallow cultivation, soil organic carbon, soil nitrogen and microbial biomass carbon were concentrated in the top 5 cm of a loess-derived silt loam (Orthic Luvisol). In the 50 cm soil profile, mass of soil organic carbon tended to be higher by about 5 Mg ha-1 as compared to conventionally ploughed soil , which contained roughly 65 Mg ha-1. In the ploughed soil, soil nitrogen amounted to about 6.8 Mg ha-1, whereas in the minimum tilled soil it was roughly 1.0 Mg ha-1 higher. Total microbial biomass carbon fluctuated between 800 and 1300 kg ha-1, the differences between tillage systems being less distinct. Ploughing the old minimum tilled land destroyed the stratification of soil organic matter. Moreover, during the winter months (November-March) the surplus of soil organic carbon and nitrogen masses, enriched by conservation tillage, was completely decomposed, presumably a consequence of its labile quality. Inverting the minimum tilled soil did not increase concentrations of organic carbon and nitrogen in the lower part of the Ap-horizon, but it did increase concentration of microbial biomass carbon. We conclude that organic matter stratification and accumulation as a result of long-term minimum tillage were completely lost by a single application of inversion tillage in the course of a relatively mild winter.

J		Article		Microbial and biochemical soil quality indicators and their potential for differentiating areas under contrasting agricultural management regimes		Bending, Gary D. (gary.bending@hri.ac.uk) ; Turner, Mary K.; Rayns, Francis; Marx, Marie-Claude; Wood, Martin									Soil Biology & Biochemistry		2004	November 2004	36	11	1785-1792	1785	1792	English	print					The aim of this study was to examine interrelationships between functional biochemical and microbial indicators of soil quality, and their suitability to differentiate areas under contrasting agricultural management regimes. The study included five 0.8 ha areas on a sandy-loam soil which had received contrasting fertility and cropping regimes over a 5 year period. These were organically managed vegetable, vegetable -cereal and arable rotations, an organically managed grass clover ley, and a conventional cereal rotation. The organic areas had been converted from conventional cereal production 5 years prior to the start of the study. All of the biochemical analyses, including light fraction organic matter (LFOM) C and N, labile organic N (LON), dissolved organic N and water-soluble carbohydrates showed significant differences between the areas, although the nature of the relationships between the areas varied between the different parameters, and were not related to differences in total soil organic matter content. The clearest differences were seen in LFOM C and N and LON, which were higher in the organic arable area relative to the other areas. In the case of the biological parameters, there were differences between the areas for biomass-N, ATP, chitin content, and the ratios of ATP: biomass and basal respiration: biomass. For these parameters, the precise relationships between the areas varied. However, relative to the conventionally managed area, areas under organic management generally had lower biomass-N and higher ATP contents. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus colonization potential was extremely low in the conventional area relative to the organic areas. Further, metabolic diversity and microbial community level physiological profiles, determined by analysis of microbial community metabolism using Biolog GN plates and the activities of eight key nutrient cycling enzymes, grouped the organic areas together, but separated them from the conventional area. We conclude that microbial parameters are more effective and consistent indicators of management induced changes to soil quality than biochemical parameters, and that a variety of biochemical and microbial analyses should be used when considering the impact of management on soil quality.

J		Article		Effect of agricultural management on soil nematode trophic structure in a Mediterranean cereal system		Garcia-Alvarez, A. (aga@ccma.csic.es) ; Arias, M.; Diez-Rojo, M. A.; Bello, A.									Applied Soil Ecology		2004	November 2004	27	3	197-210	197	210	English	print					In the context of agrarian practices in organic agriculture, the use of organic amendments is considered a way to restore biodiversity in the edaphic environment. However, large differences may exist among the different organic amendments, according to their nature and degree of decomposition. The aim of this work was to compare the effects on the nematofauna of organic compost and conventional management, in a cereal-fallow-vetch crop rotation system, and to assess the utility of nematodes as an indicator of management changes in land use and soil conditions. Bacterial-feeders predominated in the nematode community, while the least opportunistic groups had a very low occurrence. Thus, the abundance models obtained for the nematofaunal trophic structure showed best fit to a logarithmic series. Fluctuations in the nematode populations were associated with seasonal variations characteristic of the Mediterranean climate. No statistically significant differences among the fertilization treatments included in the study were observed in our study, and thus the organic amendment did not lead to any change in trophic diversity. For the rehabilitation of agricultural soils that have progressively lost a great part of their biodiversity, adequate management of the organic matter is required, introducing a source of energy to allow the functioning of the edaphic system, and thereby restoring the lost biological diversity.

J		Article		Changes in chemical and biochemical soil properties induced by 11-yr repeated additions of different organic materials in maize-based forage systems		Monaco, Stefano (stefano.monaco@unito.it) ; Hatch, David J.; Sacco, Dario; Bertora, Chiara; Grignani, Carlo									Soil Biology & Biochemistry		2008	MAR 2008	40	3	608-615	608	615	English						The repeated addition of organic materials to the soil greatly affects the physical, chemical and biological characteristics. In the present work, we analyzed changes in soil quality properties of the tilled layer caused by different agronomic managements of maize which supply different amounts of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) through the addition of slurry, farmyard manure or plant residues. The agronomic history of the analyzed soils, which derived from a medium-term (11 yr) field experiment located in NW Italy, represents typical managements of maize for this region. The area is characterized by highly intensive agriculture, with consequent risks to soil degradation that could be limited by the efficient utilization of organic inputs and by recycling within cropping systems, the large amounts of manure that are produced from the many animal breeding farms in this region. We used a combination of both different chemical (soil organic C and total N) and biochemical indicators (potential soil respiration, potentially mineralizable N (PMN) and potential soil microbial biomass (SMB)). We considered the suitability of the selected biochemical indicators to describe the changes in soil characteristics resulting from the past management.The results showed that the application of the different organic materials, in addition to urea-N fertilizer, increased SOM contents and altered the selected soil biochemical properties compared with the unfertilized treatment, especially in the upper 15cm of the 0-30 cm tilled soil layer. Farmyard manure applications caused the greatest increase in SOM content, PMN and potential SMB, whilst return of maize straw produced the largest increase in potential soil respiration, but had less effect on total soil organic C and SMB. The use of slurry only caused a moderate increase in SOM and showed intermediate changes in biochemical properties. Also, the rate of C accumulation in the soil per unit of C applied was higher for farmyard manure application than for slurry and straw incorporation in the soil. Fertilization with only mineral N did not induce an increase in C-org and N-tot and even reduces soil N mineralization potential.Because of the high variability in the data, potential SMB carbon could be considered as a less successful indicator for differentiating between past agronomic histories and effects on soil quality, whilst microbial activity (measured by potential soil respiration) and PMN, gave a more reliable and useful indication of the amount of easily decomposable organic carbon.

J		Article		Importance of the Bradhyrizobium japonicum symbiosis for the sustainability of a soybean cultivation		Panzieri, M.; Marchettini, N.; Hallam, T. G.									Ecological Modelling		2000	5 December, 2000	135	2-3	301-310	301	310	English	print					Economic development in agriculture is often accompanied by strong environmental pressures that present risks, which could lead to irreversible damage of the associated agro-ecosystem. A form of agricultural management that utilizes natural resources rationally yet maintains ecological stability is necessary. Ecologically sound, yet productive, use of resources requires indicators that assess not only productive and economic factors, but also environmental impact and ecological effects. Thus, to study an agricultural activity and its interaction with the environment, a holistic approach, capable of considering ecological, biophysical and socio-economic aspects is appropriate. Here we use emergy analysis and its indicators as given in Odum (Science 242 (1988) 1132-1139), to evaluate how sustainability of a soybean crop in south Tuscany (Italy) is increased using the specific bacteria inoculation to satisfy, through fixation, the nitrogen need of the crop. Cultivation was studied with two options: (1) utilization of chemical fertilizers to supply nitrogen needs as often done in the past, and as a viable present alternative and (2) the symbiotic activity of Bradyrhizobium bacteria, given as inoculum, to cover all nitrogen needs. This article shows that proper agricultural management should help maintain, and increase, system capacity, i.e. the quality of the system environment (soil, water,...), to sustain biomass, and prevent environmental degradation. For an Italian agro-ecosystem, the results demonstrate that agricultural production is more than doubled and the use of non-renewable and toxic inputs, such as chemical fertilizers, is reduced by use of the inoculum. The good results for soybean suggests development of analogous cultivation methods for other agricultural species, such as gramineous, for which different N-fixing bacteria such as Azospirillum, have been already identified.

J		Article		The interaction of strobilurin fungicides with cereal varieties		Bayles, Rosemary									Plant Varieties and Seeds		1999	Aug., 1999	12	2	129-140	129	140	English	print					Until the late 1990's cereal disease control in the UK had been almost entirely dependent on fungicides in two chemical groups, the DMIs and the morpholines. With the registration of the first strobilurin fungicides in 1997, a completely new class of fungicide chemistry became available to growers. It had already been widely demonstrated that strobilurins could lead to substantial yield increases, in the order of 10-20 percent above those produced by conventional fungicides. However, very little was known about the variation in response of different cereal varieties. There was a clear need to re-evaluate the yield potential and responsiveness of varieties in the light of the new fungicides. In order to do this, the National Institute of Agricultural Botany (NIAB) grew five winter wheat and five winter barely trials at widely distributed sites in England and Wales in 1998. In each trial, six fungicide programmes were applied to ten contrasting varieties. Two of the programmes were based entirely on conventional fungicides and four on strobilurin fungicides, in combination with conventionals. The average yield benefit from strobilurin-based programmes compared with conventional programmes was 1.20 t/ha (13.6%) for wheat and 0.44 t/ha (6.7%) for barley. There was a positive response from all varieties, ranging from 0.77 t/ha (8.7%) to 1.61 t/ha (18.3%) in wheat and from 0.19 t/ha (2.9%) to 0.85 t/ha (13.0%) in barley. For winter wheat, the benefit of strobilurins was least for low yielding varieties with good resistance to disease, in particular to Septoria tritici. In the case of winter barley, varieties with susceptibility to net blotch showed a particularly large benefit from strobilurins. The relative yield of varieties differed slightly depending on whether or not strobilurins were included in the fungicide programme. It is concluded that if strobilurins were to be introduced into the fungicide programmes used in Recommended List trials, there would be slight changes in the ranking of varieties according to their fungicide-treated yield.

L.; Ward, E.; Hornby, D.; Gutteridge, R. J.									Soil Biology and Biochemistry		1997		29	8	1225-1232	1225	1232	English						A mitochondrial ribosomal DNA probe (pEG34) that distinguishes two main restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) types of isolate of the take-all fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici was used to compare isolates from different host species. RFLP analysis confirmed that one type (designated T2), unlike the other type (T1), was associated more with barley than with triticale or wheat. RFLP analysis and other methods were also used to compare isolates of the take-all fungus from wheat seedlings grown in soil from first and second wheat crops, from wheat crops grown in longer sequences, and from oat crops grown as breaks from susceptible cereals. These provided samples from different stages of disease build up and decline in the take-all epidemic. Differences in frequencies of some characteristics were found at conventional significance levels (P ltoreq 0.05): in a cereal sequence experiment at Rothamsted, U.K., isolates containing dsRNA were less frequent in T2 isolates than T1 isolates except in second wheats; perithecia were produced more abundantly on roots of wheat seedlings inoculated with T1 isolates than with T2 isolates, regardless of their origin. A weaker association (P ltoreq 0.1) was also found: T2 isolates were often more frequent from second wheat crops, before take-all peaked in wheat sequences, than from other wheat crops or oats break crops. Collectively, the findings add only modest support to the controversial hypothesis that changes in the population of the take-all fungus occur during repeated cropping of wheat. The limitations of traditional sampling and assessment methods in such studies are discussed.	Bateman, G.

Although typically considered a cereal contaminant, it has also been detected in dried fruit, nuts, meat and derivatives. To estimate the quantity of ochratoxin A that might be ingested by Italian consumers from these foods, 211 cereal derivatives (flours and bakery products) were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Products were from conventional and organic agriculture and from integrated pest management agriculture. All commercial. ours and derivatives examined contained ochratoxin A at concentrations very much below the legal limit (3 mug kg-1): the highest value, 0.816 mug kg-1, was detected in a sample of spelt whole. our from organic agriculture. In many samples, the ochratoxin content was below the limit of detection; only rarely did values exceed 0.5 mug kg-1. In baby foods, four samples were above the particularly restrictive Italian legal limit of 0.5 mug kg-1. Although some significant differences were found between samples from conventional and organic agriculture when some product categories were examined (namely, baby foods as semolina and rice creams), no important difference was found between the two types of agricultural practice when all types of cereal derivatives were considered together.

Diagnostic tools and detailed statistical approaches need to be developed for a reliable evaluation of these parameters, in order to allow classification and quantification of the magnitude of such effects. The DOK long-term agricultural field experiment was initiated in 1978 in Switzerland for the evaluation of organic and conventional farming practices. It includes three representative Swiss farming systems with biodynamic, bio-organic and conventional fertilization and plant protection schemes along with minerally fertilized and unfertilized controls. Effects on microbial soil characteristics induced by the long-term management at two different stages in the crop rotation, i.e. winter wheat after potato or corn, were investigated by analyzing soil bacterial community structures using analysis of PCR-amplified rRNA genes by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis. Application of farmyard manure consistently revealed the strongest influence on bacterial community structures and biomass contents. Effects of management and plant protection regimes occurred on an intermediate level, while the two stages in the crop rotation had a marginal influence that was not significant.

J		Article		Responses of soil organic matter and greenhouse gas fluxes to soil management and land use changes in a humid temperate region of southern Europe		Merino, Agustin (amerino@lugo.usc.es) ; Perez-Batallon, Pilar; Macias, Felipe									Soil Biology & Biochemistry		2004	May 2004	36	6	917-925	917	925	English	print					We studied the effects of soil management and changes of land use on soils of three adjacent plots of cropland, pasture and oak (Quercus robur) forest. The pasture and the forest were established in part of the cropland, respectively, 20 and 40 yr before the study began. Soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics, water-filled pore space (WFPS), soil temperature, inorganic N and microbial C, as well as fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O were measured in the plots over 25 months. The transformation of the cropland to mowed pasture slightly increased the soil organic and microbial C contents, whereas afforestation significantly increased these variables. The cropland and pasture soils showed low CH4 uptake rates (< 1 kg C ha-1 yr-1) and, coinciding with WFPS values >70%, episodes of CH4 emission, which could be favoured by soil compaction. In the forest site, possibly because of the changes in soil structure and microbial activity, the soil always acted as a sink for CH4 (4.7 kg C ha-1 yr-1). The N2O releases at the cropland and pasture sites (2.7 and 4.8 kg N2O-N ha-1 yr-1) were, respectively, 3 and 6 times higher than at the forest site (0.8 kg N2O-N ha-1 yr-1). The highest N2O emissions in the cultivated soils were related to fertilisation and slurry application, and always occurred when the WFPS > 60%. These results show that the changes in soil properties as a consequence of the transformation of cropfield to intensive grassland do not imply substantial changes in SOM or in the dynamics of CH4 and N2O. On the contrary, afforestation resulted in increases in SOM content and CH4 uptake, as well as decreases in N2O emissions. Copyright 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J		Article		Pyrolysis-gas chromatography to evaluate the organic matter quality of a mulched soil		Ceccanti, B.; Masciandaro, G. (grazia.masciandaro@ise.cnr.it) ; Macci, C.									Soil & Tillage Research		2007	NOV 2007	97	1	71-78	71	78	English						Pyrolysis-gas chromatography (Py-GC) permits to study the organic matter properties in bulk soil and requires few manipulations with respect to the traditional methodologies based on extraction and fractionation processes. In this paper, Py-GC has been proposed as a quick and valuable technique to study the structural evolution of organic matter in a mulched soil. A sandy clay loam soil (rendzina soil) was treated, under field conditions in the south-east of England, with organic (compost from dairy manure at the rates of 35 and 70 t ha(-1), wheat straw at the rates of 2 and 4 t ha-1, plant residues representing the no-till treatment) and inert (black polyethylene) mulching materials. Nitrogen fertilization was considered as a traditional chemical treatment, while the control was an unmulched and no-fertilized soil. The objective of this research was to evaluate short-term (4 months) changes on chemico-structural properties of soil organic matter (SOM) and its trend towards mineralization and humification after mulching practices. Total and water-soluble C and N forms of the 0-10 cm layer were determined. Py-GC was used as a rapid and reproducible investigation technique (chemical probe) to characterize SOM. Pyrolytic humification and mineralization indices have been calculated. Compost increased the content of soil total and soluble C and N. On the other hand, straw mulched soil, due to straw being a poorly degradable material, showed both a relatively low N concentration of total and soluble forms and also the lowest concentration of water-soluble C (WSC). Pyrolytic data supported these results. Compost and straw treatments were characterized by low and high B/E3 indices, and high and low AL/AR ratios, respectively, suggesting the presence of more easily available organic components in compost mulched soils. Principal component analysis (PCA) confirmed that compost treatments were principally related to soluble C and N and labile organic compounds, while straw and no-till showed stable SOM. Control, N fertilization and polyethylene treatments showed a similar SOM composition, which was characterized by pyrolytic fragments derived mostly from microbially linked nitrogenated compounds. The pyrolysis technique is a promising method in the assessment of changes in SOM composition, even in complex and dynamic mulching systems. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Food Chemistry		1993		48	3	255-258	255	258	English						Studies were conducted on the growth and cultivation of Pleurotus tuber-regium on local cellulosic wastes. Andropogon tectorum straw supported the greatest mycelial growth, and cotton and oil palm pericarp wastes supported the least. For cultivation of edible sclerotia, cotton waste the rice straw gave the highest yield and banana leaves gave the lowest. However, with regard to protein, lipid, ethanol-soluble sugar, crude fibre, calcium and magnesium contents, the sclerotia grown on banana leaves were the richest. In contrast, the sclerotia cultivated on corn cob were the poorest in sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and phosphorus contents. In all the sclerotia cultivated on banana leaves, corn cob, cotton waste and rice straw, protein and potassium were the most abundant nutrients. These results are discussed in relation to the prospect of cultivating P. tuber-regium in Nigeria.	Dep. Bot. and Microbiol., Univ.

J		Article		Low input no-till cereal production in the Pacific Northwest of the US: The challenges of root diseases		Paulitz, Timothy C. (paulitz@wsu.edu)									European Journal of Plant Pathology		2006	JUL 2006	115	3	271-281	271	281	English						Direct-seeding or no-till is defined as planting directly into residue of the previous crop without tillage that mixes or stirs soil prior to planting. No-till reduces soil erosion, improves soil structure and organic matter, and reduces fuel inputs. No-till is widely used in cereal production in Australia, Canada, Argentina, and Brazil, but has not been widely adopted in Europe and the Pacific Northwest of the U.S. One of the limitations is that root diseases may increase with a reduction in tillage. This paper discusses the importance and management of take-all, Fusarium dryland foot rot, Rhizoctonia bare patch and root rot, and Pythium root rot in dryland cereal production systems, and how they are influenced by changes in tillage practices. To address this challenge, specifically with Rhizoctonia and Pythium, our research group has (1) developed classical and molecular techniques to detect and quantify Rhizoctonia and Pythium spp. from the soil to assess disease risk; (2) studied the disease dynamics of root disease during the transition from conventional to no-till; (3) developed greenhouse methods to screen germplasm for tolerance or resistance to Pythium and Rhizoctonia, and (4) using GPS and geostatistics, has examined the spatial distribution of R. solani and R. oryzae at a field scale up to 36 ha, across a number of crop rotations and years. By a combination of ecological, epidemiological, field, and laboratory studies, we hope to provide growers with a set of disease management tools to permit the economical and sustainable production of dryland cereals without degradation of the soil resource.

J		Article		Soil microbial properties and the assessment of available soil organic matter in a haplic Luvisol after several years of different cultivation and crop rotation		Friedel, J. K.; Munch, J. C.; Fischer, W. R.									Soil Biology and Biochemistry		1996		28	4-5	479-488	479	488	English						Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) contents, enzymatic activities, cellulose decomposition in situ, aggregate stability, total organic C contents, C- and N-mineralization potentials and amounts of water-soluble C compounds were measured in the plough layer of field plots from a haplic Luvisol at the 'Ihinger Hof' near Stuttgart, SW Germany. Plots had been treated differently for 14 years with regard to tillage (ploughing, rotary cultivation) and crop rotations (legume-cereals, rape-cereals). Soils were sampled from the 0-10 cm and 10-25 cm layer of the Ap horizon 4 times in 1990 during and after the vegetative growth of oats. On the basis of the input and distribution of crop and root residues during the previous 8 years a model for the decomposition of organic substances was used to estimate the amounts of the microbially-decomposable organic substances added to the plots (decomposable young soil organic matter, DYSOM). Our aim was to study the effects of management practices on soil microbial properties and to relate those effects to changes in the microbially-available part of the soil organic matter. The contents of total soil organic C, total N, ATP, and soil microbial activities in the 0-10 cm layer were mostly higher with rotary cultivation than with ploughing. In contrast, either no differences between the tillage systems or higher values with ploughing occurred in the second soil layer (10-25 cm). In the upper soil layer of the rape-cereals crop rotation soil microbial biomass was higher and more active than in the legume-cereals crop rotation. In the lower soil layer no uniform effects of the crop rotations were found. For the 0-10 cm layer there was an overlapping effect of cultivation and crop rotation on soil organic matter fractions and microbial biomass. Differences in soil microbial measurements were partly related to differences in humus contents. However, variations in microbial properties with different treatments were mostly larger than variations in total organic C content, sometimes occurring without any difference in total organic C contents. In these cases the contents of DYSOM and soil pH were found to have a dominant influence. Soil physical properties either showed only little differences (texture, bulk density), or were highly correlated to total organic C contents (water contents). There seemed to be a contradiction between a tendency for higher microbial activities and at the same time larger humus contents on plots with rotary cultivation compared to ploughing. This may be explained by a higher C efficiency in these plots, i.e. the soil microbial biomass-to-organic C ratio was relatively high and accompanied by small changes in biomass contents during the year.

(ariena.vanbruggen@wur.nl)									Applied Soil Ecology		2006	JAN 2006	31	1-2	120-135	120	135	English						A comparative study of organic and conventional arable farming systems was conducted in The Netherlands to determine the effect of management practices on chemical and biological soil properties and soil health. Soils from thirteen accredited organic farms and conventionally managed neighboring farms were analyzed using a polyphasic approach combining traditional soil analysis, culture-dependent and independent microbiological analyses, a nematode community analysis and an enquiry about different management practices among the farmers. Organic management, known primarily for the abstinence of artificial fertilizers and pesticides, resulted in significantly lower levels of both nitrate and total soluble nitrogen in the soil, higher numbers of bacteria of different trophic groups, as well as larger species richness in both bacteria and nematode communities and more resilience to a drying-rewetting disturbance in the soil. The organic farmers plough their fields less deeply and tend to apply more organic carbon to their fields, but this did not result in a significantly higher organic carbon content in their soils. The levels of ammonium, organic nitrogen, phosphate and total phosphorus did not differ, significantly between the soils under different management. Fifty percent of the conventional Dutch farmers also used organic fertilizers and the numbers of farmers using a green crop fertilizer did not differ between the two management types. Soil type - clayey or sandy soil - in general had a much stronger effect on the soil characteristics than management type. The soil type influenced pH, nitrate, ammonium, phosphate and organic carbon levels as well as numbers of oligotrophic bacteria and of different groups of nematodes, and different diversity indices. With the collected data set certain soil characteristics could also be attributed to the use of different management practices like plow depth, crop or cover crop type or to the management history of the soil.

J		Article		Distribution of ergosterol in organically and conventionally cultivated agricultural soils		Jensen, Ulla Birgitte; Elmholt, Susanne; Labouriau, Rodrigo									Biological Agriculture and Horticulture		2000		18	2	113-125	113	125	English	print					Ergosterol is generally assumed to be one of the best indicators of fungal biomass and soil quality. The present case studies describe variations in ergosterol content in soil, sampled at three Danish farms. One is organically cultivated according to the biodynamical principles (ORG). The other two are conventionally cultivated, one with animal husbandry (CONV-H) and one with plant production (CONV-P). The analytical method combined extraction in a microwave oven, clean-up with a new SPE sorbent material (OasisTM), and quantification by HPLC. The average estimated concentrations of ergosterol were 1.66 mug g-1 in ORG, 2.35 mug g-1 in CONV-H and 1.13 mug g-1 in CONV-P. These results correlated well with some of the important variables in the management systems of the soils (frequency of grass and clover, input of animal manure, total-C, frequency of ploughing). However, the exact causal relationships cannot be revealed using the case-study approach. The statistical analysis of the spatial variation in ergosterol across the field demonstrated very clearly that in some soils, small-scale (few cm2) variations in ergosterol concentrations may be quite large in comparison with large scale (few hundred m2) variations. This should be taken into account when planning the sampling strategy.

Commercial fields consisting of conventional corn (Dracma) and Bt176 transgenic corn (Compa CB) were located in three climatic regions. The effect of corn type, plant material, field location, stage of sampling and year of study were studied on total and ampicillin resistant bacterial population levels, on median effective dose and on the slope of the dose-response curve to ampicillin. None of the parameters measured were significantly different (P < 0.01) between transgenic and non-transgenic cornfields under the diverse conditions studied. However, in population levels of ampicillin resistant bacteria, the minimum difference between sample means to be significant with a likelihood of 80% was 8.9%. Specific detection of putative bacteria harbouring bla TEM-1 ampicillin resistance genes acquired from Bt176 corn was performed with a method based on the extraction of DNA from the culturable bacterial fraction and with PCR. Primers for PCR were targeted to the bla gene and the corresponding flanking regions present in the pUC18 cloning vector or the Bt176 construct. The culturable bacterial fraction of 144 field samples (up to 864 analysis, including ampicillin enrichments) was analysed by PCR. The estimated total number of bacteria analysed was 108. The level of detection of a transfer event according to the sensitivity of the methods used was 10-6. Four samples of transgenic and five of non-transgenic corn gave positive signals. However, the amplification products did not correspond to the ones expected from Bt176 or pUC18. The limitations of the sampling design and of the methods used are discussed.

Wesley									Soil Science Society of America Journal		2008	JAN-FEB 2008	72	1	221-230	221	230	English						Quantification of the impact of long-term agricultural land use on soil organic C (SOC) is important to farmers and policyrnakers, but few studies have characterized land use and management effects on SOC across physiographic regions. We measured the distribution and total stock of SOC to a depth of 20 cm under conventional tillage (CvT), conservation tillage (CsT), and pasture in 87 production fields from the Southern Piedmont and Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Areas. Across locations, SOC at a depth of 0 to 20 cm was: pasture (38.9 Mg ha(-1)) > CsT (27.9 Mg ha(-1)) > CvT (22.2 Mg ha(-1)) (P <= 0.02). Variation in SOC was explained by management (41.6%), surface horizon clay content (5.2%), and mean annual temperature (1.0%). Higher clay content and cooler temperature contributed to higher SOC. Management affected SOC primarily at the soil surface (0-5 cm). All SOC fractions (i.e., total SOC, particulate organic C, soil microbial biomass C, and potential C mineralization) were strongly correlated across a diversity of soils and management systems (r = 0.85-0.96). The stratification ratio (concentration at the soil surface/concentration at a lower depth) of SOC fractions differed among management systems (P <= 0.0001), and was 4.2 to 6.1 under pastures, 2.6 to 4.7 under CsT and 1.4 to 2.4 under CvT; these results agree with a threshold value of 2 to distinguish historically degraded soils with improved soil conditions from degraded soils. This on-farm survey of SOC complements experimental data and shows that pastures and conservation tillage will lead to significant SOC sequestration throughout the region, resulting in improved soil quality and potential to mitigate CO2 emissions.

Soil & Tillage Research		2005	DEC 2005	84	2	216-221	216	221	English						Changes in some soil chemical, including N-15 values, and biochemical properties (microbial C, FDA hydrolysis, glucosidase and urease activities) due to two tillage systems, conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT), were evaluated in an acid soil from temperate humid zone (NW of Spain) and compared with values obtained for a reference forest soil. The results showed that in the surface layer (0-5 cm depth) tillage tended to increase soil pH and to decrease organic matter levels and microbial biomass and activity values. The data also indicated that 8 years of NT, compared to CT, resulted in greater organic matter content and increased microbial biomass and activity, the changes being more pronounced for the microbial properties. Adoption of NT resulted in an increase of soil C storage of 1.24 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) with regard to CT. The suitability of N-15 as a potential tracer of land-use in this acid soil was also confirmed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Hanel, Ladislav (hanel@upb.cas.cz)									Biologia (Bratislava)		2003	March 2003	58	2	205-216	205	216	English	print					Soil nematodes were studied in 16 conventional agroecosystems of five crops (wheat, barley, oats, potatoes, and clovers) in S, SW and NW Bohemia. About 60 genera and 160 species of soil nematodes were identified and the majority of dominant species belonged to the orders Rhabditida and Tylenchida. Most nematode individuals were bacterivores (48%) and plant parasites (24%). The total mean nematode abundance varied from about 0.5 to 2.1X106 ind. m-2, the total biomass from 0.2 to 1.1 g m-2, and the mean biomass of a nematode individual in community from 0.22 to 0.63 mug live weight. Region and cultivated plant were the main factors influencing taxonomic composition of nematode communities. Matrix classification of nematode functional guilds revealed food webs in the majority of agroecosystems as 'disturbed' to 'degraded'. Decomposition channels in the field soils, as indicated by nematodes, varied from fungal through fungal-bacterial to bacterial pathways and seemed to be influenced by both regional and crop factors.

J		Article		Soil quality in mediterranean mountain environments: Effects of land use change		Sanchez-Maranon, M.; Soriano, M.; Delgado, G.; Delgado, R.									Soil Science Society of America Journal		2002	May-June, 2002	66	3	948-958	948	958	English	print					Unsuitable land use worldwide has led to environmental degradation. Land use effects on the environmental component of soil quality were assessed in 47 benchmark soils of three natural environments (Xerolls, Xerepts, and Cryepts) in southern Spain. Within each environment, soil groups with traditional land uses were compared with native sites. Soil quality changes were inferred by measuring the relative changes in chemical and physical soil properties. Irrigated terraces, rainfed cropland, and grassland, all within Xerepts, and grazed thyme scrub land were degraded with respect to native sites (significant differences at P < 0.05). In all cases, total porosity, macroporosity, and cation exchange capacity declined by more than 18% (-0.11 cm3 cm-3), 30% (-0.11 cm3 cm-3), and 48% (-10.5 cmol(+) kg-1), respectively. Except in irrigated terraces, soil erodibility increased by as much as 59% (+0.16 USLE factor). Substantial losses of soil organic C (37%, -14.7 Mg ha-1), available water (52%, -36.2 mm), total N (65%, -1.7 Mg ha-1), and rooting depth (68%, -39 cm) were also observed in grassland and thyme scrub land. These changes suggest adverse effects on environmental protection functions of soil because of soil compaction and/or elimination of structural binding agents. Scanning electron microscopy images confirmed these morphological changes in microaggregates. Similar changes did not occur in cropland and grassland within Cryepts or in planted pine forest land. Reforestation with pine (Pinus nigra Arnold, Pinus sylvestris L., and Pinus uncinata Mill. ex Mirb.) provided organic cements and fungal hyphae that reinforce soil aggregation as well as ecologically valuable humus. Because cropland and grassland were able to recover the natural soil properties without human activity, we deduce that Cryepts are resilient.

As part of a Spanish specific monitoring program for Bt maize, a farm-scale study was initiated in 2000 to assess the potential impacts of Bt maize on predatory arthropods. The trials were conducted at two maize growing areas (Lleida and Madrid) over 3 years. In each locality three treatments (each with 3-4 replicates of 0.4-0.7ha) were arranged in a completely randomised block design, Bt-maize (cv. Compa CB) being compared with the isogenic cv. Dracma under conventional farm practices, with or without the insecticide (imidacloprid) seed treatment. Predator abundance was monitored front late May to mid September in Lleida and from mid June to mid September in Madrid by visual surveys and pitfall traps. Anthocoridae. Coccinellidae, and Araneae represented about 90% of the total number of predators recorded in visual samplings whereas Carabidae and Araneae were the two prevalent predator groups (85-90% of the total predators) collected in pitfall traps. Their abundance varied from year to year and between locations, but no clear tendencies related to Bt maize was recorded. Insecticide treatment reduced anthocorid numbers occasionally but no consistent effects were found for the rest of predators. Our data suggest that Bt maize is compatible with the naturally occurring predators. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J		Article		The sustenance of soddy-podzolic soil fertility created by the long-term application of chemicals.		Mineev, V. G.; Gomonova, N. F.; Ovchinnikova, M. F.									Agrokhimiya		2003	February 2003		2	5-9	5	9	Russian	print					A study in soddy podzolic soil at the university field site near Moscow (Russia) showed that the use of a complex of agrochemical agents makes it possible to create agrocenoses with a specific bioproductivity to regulate soil fertility, humus formation, and humification. When mineral fertilizers were applied for a prolonged period to acidic, slightly cultivated, soddy-podzolic soil, together with some improvement in the nutrient conditions, negative soil qualities associated with podzolization developed. Periodic liming of soil, due to the neutralization of excess acidity, improved the physical and chemical properties, increased the humus level, and improved humus quality. The highest soil fertility and bioproductivity was achieved with the combined use of organic/mineral fertilizers with lime. A high and stable bioproductivity of limed soils was retained for at least 9-13 years without the use of agrochemical agents; this was chiefly responsible for the high quality of the humus: fulvate/humate composition, high degree of humification, and predominance of the agriculturally most valuable calcium humates, which are resistant to microbiological decomposition. Crops grown on this soil included barley, sunflowers, corn, oats, vetch/oat mixture, and winter wheat.					0	0		0	9	25			Agriculture	0002-1881				Agronomy (Agriculture); Soil Science	52502, Agronomy - Miscellaneous and mixed crops; 52504, Agronomy - Grain crops; 52506, Agronomy - Forage crops and fodder; 52801, Soil science - General and methods	Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Compositae [25840]; [sunflower]/Monocotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Monocots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Gramineae [25305]; [barley; (grain crop)] [corn; (grain crop)] [oats; (grain crop)] [winter wheat; (grain crop)]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Leguminosae [26260]; [vetch; (forage crop)]		humus			Russia; Asia, Europe; Palearctic region		fertilizer application; applied and field techniques/liming; applied and field techniques						2022-07-19	BCI:BCI200400145127
J		Article		Characterization of the microbial community of lotic organic aggregates ('river snow') in the Elbe River of Germany by cultivation and molecular methods		Boeckelmann, Uta; Manz, Werner; Neu, Thomas R.; Szewzyk, Ulrich									FEMS Microbiology Ecology		2000	August, 2000	33	2	157-170	157	170	English	print					Aerobic and anaerobic cultivation techniques, 16S rDNA-based phylogeny, and fluorescent in situ hybridization were used to describe the phylogenetic diversity and physiological versatility of lotic microbial aggregates ('river snow') obtained from the river Elbe. In the course of the year the 'river snow' community changed. It was characterized by a great bacterial diversity in spring, the predominant occurrence of algae in summer and reduction of the total bacterial cell count in autumn and winter. In all 'river snow' samples, more than 70% of the bacteria counted with the general DNA stain DAPI also hybridized with the Bacteria-specific probe EUB338. In situ analysis of the bacterial 'river snow' community with a comprehensive suite of specific rRNA-targeted probes revealed population dynamics to be governed by seasonal factors. During all seasons, beta-Proteobacteria constituted the numerically most important bacterial group forming up to 54% of the total cell counts. In contrast to this, the relative abundance of other major bacterial lineages ranged from 2% for the order Planctomycetales to 36% for Cytophaga-Flavobacteria. Cultivation of 'river snow' under aerobic and anaerobic conditions with a variety of different media resulted in the isolation of 40 new bacterial strains. Phenotypic and phylogenetic analyses revealed these new strains to be mostly unknown organisms affiliated to different bacterial phyla. Application of newly developed specific oligonucleotide probes proved the cultivated bacteria, including clostridia and the numerically abundant beta-Proteobacteria, as relevant in situ members of the 'river snow' community.

H.; Bouwman, L. A.									Nematologica		1994		40	2	249-257	249	257	English						Addition of organic matter to soil may indirectly enhance nematophagous fungi. The effect of organic amendments on the population dynamics of the endoparasitic nematophagous fungus Drechmeria coniospora was studied in soil microcosm experiments. In one experiment, soil was amended with lucerne meal, and in a second experiment the root system of barley served as the source of organic matter. Indigenous soil bacteria, the bacterivorous nematodes Rhabditis sp. or Acrobeloides butschlii, and D. coniospora were added as representatives of the first, second, and third trophic level. In lucerne meal amended soil, the conidial density of D. coniospora increased in response to increase in number of nematodes. Rhabditis sp. appeared to be a more susceptible host than A. butschlii. Nematode population density was suppressed by D. coniospora. In the rhizosphere of barley, a small but significant increase in the conidial density was measured as compared to the control without nematodes, but nematode numbers were not suppressed. In rhizosphere soil from two fields, the densities of endoparasitic and trapping fungi were not related to numbers of nematodes. Drechmeria coniospora was not detected in the field. We conclude that introduction of conidia of D. coniospora in combination with high input of organic matter may lead to suppressive levels of the fungus.

J		Article		Broiler chicken health, welfare and fluctuating asymmetry in organic versus conventional production systems		Tuyttens, Frank (frank.tuyttens@ilvo.vlaanderen.be) ; Heyndrickx, Marc; De Boeck, Maja; Moreels, Anneleen; Van Nuffel, Annelies; Van Poucke, Els; Van Coillie, Els; Van Dongen, Stefan; Lens, Luc									Livestock Science		2008	FEB 2008	113	2-3	123-132	123	132	English						The aim of this study was to test three predictions: (1) that a combination of animal-based parameters indicates better health and welfare in broilers from organic versus conventional farms, (2) that broilers from organic farms show less fluctuating asymmetry (FA) than broilers from conventional farms, and (3) that, at the level of the individual bird, the relationship between FA and welfare is negative and strongest in conventional broilers. On 140 slaughter-age birds randomly selected from seven organic and seven conventional flocks in Belgium we measured standardised FA and five conventional animal-based welfare indicators (tonic immobility duration, latency-to-lie, and condition of the foot pad, hock, and breast). The caeca from the birds from four organic and four conventional flocks were removed for assessing the presence of two bacterial pathogens (Salmonella and Campylobacter) and the concentration of the health-promoting lactic acid bacteria. Finally, the blood serum concentration of the acute phase protein alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), a nonspecific indicator of immunological stress, was determined. Salmonella was found in the caeca content of two (2.5%) birds only (both from the same conventional farm), whereas 44 (55.7%) birds were infected with Campylobacter. The prevalence of Campylobacter, the concentration of lactic acid bacteria, the duration of tonic immobility, and the condition of the breast and foot pad did not differ between both production systems. Apart from a higher concentration of AGP, organic birds had better scores for hock condition and a longer latency-to-lie indicating better leg health. In addition, organic birds scored better on the aggregated welfare index (i.e. the average of the five standardised welfare indicators). As both production systems differed in many aspects (e.g. slower-growing genotypes, slaughter age, feed, stocking density, group size) it is impossible to assign differences in welfare/health indicators to a single factor. Whatever the causes may be our findings suggest that, despite the potentially elevated risk of immunological challenge, broiler chicken welfare is generally superior in organic farms as compared with conventional farms in Belgium. Regarding the validity of FA as welfare indicator, the prediction of lower FA in the population with highest aggregated welfare score was confirmed but, at the level of the individual, no associations between FA and the aggregated welfare index were found irrespective of whether data from organic and conventional broilers were analysed separately or combined.

Tillage techniques and crop rotations significantly modified both the composition and the structure of the fungal community. Quantitative and qualitative changes on some fungal taxa during the two different sampling periods were observed. Cluster analysis showed that fungal community of barley is different from the community of wheat.

The results showed that the differences between the two groups at the same age, expressed by the bacterial count, are not conclusive in showing an influence of the rearing systems. Salmonella Hadar was isolated once in caeca of conventional and once in caeca of organic ones. Though the results are preliminary and referred to a well defined geographic area in Central Italy, Salmonella detection does not seem to be common in conventional and organic chicken farms.

J		Article		Event specific transgene detection in Bt11 corn by quantitative PCR at the integration site		Zimmermann, Andreas; Luthy, Jurg; Pauli, Urs									Lebensmittel-Wissenschaft and Technologie		2000		33	3	210-216	210	216	English	print					The genetically modified corn Bt11 from Novartis is widely cultivated for porduction of foodstuffs or fodder. Due to the insertion and expression of a 6.3 kb sequence containing a Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)-transgene coding for a synthetic cryIA(b) delta-endotoxin, the Bt11-corn is resistant against lepidopteran insects, especially against the European corn borer. As labelling of genetically modified foodstuffs is mandatory in many European countries, several methods to detect genetically modified organisms (GMOs) qualitatively have been described. Since these 'conventional' detection systems are all based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifying unique sequences within the integrated transgenic constructs, they may lead to ambiguous results in qualitative and especially in quantitative analysis of GMOs in foodstuffs and fodder. In this study, we report the characterization of the genomic sequence at the 5-site of the integrated transgenic sequence in the Bt11-corn genome using inverse PCR. The integration border was subsequently used to develop a novel and unambiguous PCR detection system covering the integration border at the 5 site of the transgene. The genomic sequence showed high similarities with a corn-specific 180 bp knob-associated repeat region. By using one primer annealing exactly at the integration border between the transgenic construct and the corn genome and the other within the vector sequence of the transgenic construct, a 207 bp product was amplified. After insertion of a 22 bp fragment, the amplification product was subsequently used as a competitor in quantitative competitive PCR (qcPCR). Finally, the qcPCR-system was calibrated to an equivalence point of 1% Bt11-DNA.

Oats (cv. Stork) were artificially infested with bird cherry-oat aphids (Rhopalosiphum padi) carrying a local Swedish PAV-Sto isolate. Infection, especially in early growth stages, decreased yield of grain biomass and plant height, but increased the number of tillers and panicles per plant, compared to uninfected plants. There was no effect on 1000-kernel weight and grain volume weight. The results emphasize the importance of barley yellow dwarf virus infection, especially at early growth stages in affecting oat yields.

The cytotoxicity of the samples was analyzed with an in vitro test using feline fetal lung cells. Overall, the concentrations of the mycotoxins studied were low in all of the samples. Enniatins B and B1 as well as deoxynivalenol were the most predominant mycotoxins in the samples, being present in 97%, 97%, and 90% of the samples, respectively. The geographical origin or the agricultural practice had no influence on the mycotoxin concentrations of the samples. The babyfoods included in the samples had significantly lower concentrations of mycotoxins than the other products with a mean total mycotoxin content of 47 mug/kg compared with 99 mug/kg for the other kinds of food. All the samples evoked toxicity in the in vitro test, but no correlation between cytotoxicity and the mycotoxin concentrations was observed.

J		Article		Carbon and nitrogen stocks in relation to organic matter fractions, aggregation and pore size distribution in no-tillage and conventional tillage in northern France		Oorts, Katrien; Bossuyt, H.; Labreuche, J.; Merckx, R.; Nicolardot, B. (bernard.nicolardot@reims.inra.fr)									European Journal of Soil Science		2007	FEB 2007	58	1	248-259	248	259	English						The magnitude of and mechanisms for long-term differences in soil organic matter stocks under no-tillage and conventional tillage are still relatively poorly known. We quantified differences in total C and N stocks after 32 years of no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) in plots with a long-term cultivation history before differentiation and the same annual C and N returns to the soil. The role of physical protection of organic matter (OM) in these stock differences was further investigated by examining the changes at different levels of structural complexity, i.e. organic matter fractions, aggregation and pore-size distribution. Four structural zones were sampled: loose and dense soil zones under CT and the 0-5 cm (rich in OM) and 5-20 cm (massive structure) soil layers under NT. The C and N stocks, calculated for an equivalent mass of dry soil, were only 10-15% larger under NT than under CT. Mineral-associated N and particulate organic matter accounted for about 50% of the difference in N stocks. However, 66% of the total difference in C stocks was due to differences in the particulate organic matter (58%) and free residues (8%) fractions. The additional C and N under NT were almost exclusively situated in aggregates larger than 250 mu m in diameter. Our results suggest that physical protection of OM under NT contributes significantly to the differences in C and N stocks between NT and CT by (i) enhanced macroaggregate formation in the 0-5 cm layer due to greater microbial activity and OM content and (ii) a better protection of soil organic matter in the 5-20 cm layer due to the presence of small pores and lack of soil disruption by tillage or climate.

J		Article		Biodiversity and agri-environmental indicators: General scopes and skills with special reference to the habitat level.		Buechs, Wolfgang (w.buechs@bba.de)									Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment		2003	September 2003	98	1-3	35-78	35	78	English	print					This synoptic review has the intention to summarise and highlight results in respect to the area "biodiversity and habitat" considering the current "state of the art" with regard the development of biotic indicator approaches that refer to the fauna of agro-ecosystems. Most political statements (e.g. "Convention of Biodiversity Development": Agenda 21, Convention of Rio 1992) as well as existing approaches regarding the development of biotic agri-environmental indicators focus mainly and almost exclusively on "biodiversity", the enhancement of which is the overall target for the development of agricultural landscapes towards sustainability. In this regard the understanding of the term "biodiversity" is rather different: it is largely interpreted as species richness, only occasionally as the richness of varieties, cultivars or genetical expressions (e.g. microorganisms). A survey on the understanding of biotic indicators is presented including aspects of nomenclature, categorisation and definitions as well as preconditions and rules for their use. Requirements for different taxa (mostly invertebrates) to act as biotic indicators are summarised and several attempts to use animals on the population and/or community level as biotic indicators for biodiversity or other goals in agro-ecosystems are discussed critically as well as their replacement by surrogate indicators. Regarding the sensitivity of indicators it will be highlighted that it is necessary to evaluate and to compare cultivation intensities, that are rather similar (e.g. gradual differences in conventional managed farms and landscapes) as well as those displaying much larger differences (e.g. organic farming versus conventional farming), because conventional farms currently cover nearly 90% of the agriculturally used area in Europe. Other fundamental problems regarding the development of biotic indicators as baselines, sample size, frequency of surveys, mutual neutralisation of indicators, double assessments, selection of taxa, etc. are addressed. Finally an assessment of the practicality, the power of indication statements and the remaining work required to validate indicators will be provided for discussion, as well as suggestions for a simplification of indicator systems in order to minimise the input needed for data recording.

J		Article		A comparative study of the microbiology of soils managed under organic and conventional regimes.		Shannon, D.; Sen, A. M.; Johnson, D. B. (d.b.johnson@bangor.ac.uk)									Soil Use and Management		2002	September 2002	18	Supplement	274-283	274	283	English	print					Previous studies of the microbial status of soils managed under 'organic' and 'conventional' regimes have produced conflicting evidence of whether there are distinct differences in the size, composition and activity of the soil microbial biomass which may be attributed to management practice. In the present study, we have compared the microbiology of organically- and conventionally-managed soils at (primarily) two farms in England, over a two year period. Differences in microbial communities in soils under different management practice were subtle rather than dramatic. Many of the parameters measured, including total C and microbial biomass C, often showed no consistently significant differences in soils under different management. In soils from one farm, concentrations of ATP in Ringers solution soil extracts were mostly found to be significantly greater in organically-managed than in comparable conventionally-managed soils. While indirect (plate) counts showed that there were similar numbers of cultivable microorganisms present in these soils, total counts of bacteria (via DAPI-staining) were found to parallel the trends found for readily-extractable ATP. Numbers of metabolically-active bacteria, determined by FISH analysis using a EUB338 probe to detect ribosome-rich cells, indicated that the percentage of metabolically-active bacteria present was not determined by management practice. Total and active fungi were also found to be more abundant in organically-managed soils. It was concluded that changes in soil microbiology may occur as a consequence of switching to organic land management, but these may not be detectable by methods used frequently to assess soil biomass.

J		Article		Rapid degradation of the Cry3Bb1 protein from Diabrotica-resistant Bt-corn MON88017 during ensilation and fermentation in biogas production facilities		Rauschen, Stefan (Rauschen@Bio5.RWTH-Aachen.de) ; Nguyen, Hang Thu; Schuphan, Ingolf; Jehle, Johannes A.; Eber, Sabine									Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture		2008	AUG 15 2008	88	10	1709-1715	1709	1715	English						BACKGROUND: Insect-resistant transgenic corn is meeting a growing adoption in Europe. Corn is also the major substrate for biogas production, which has vastly increased in recent years. In areas with high insect pest pressure Bt-corn silage will consequently be fed into biogas production facilities. To assess the potential risks of transgenic plants as energy crops we investigated the fate of the coleopteran-specific protein Cry3Bb1 from MON88017 corn in the utilization chain of a farm-scale biogas production facility using ELISA.RESULTS: The mean Cry3Bb1 protein content in chaffed MONS8017 plant material was 15 mu g g(-1). In silage the content decreased rapidly, with less than 20 ng g(-1) detectable after S months. From the start of fermentation in the biogas reactor, only trace amounts of Cry3Bb1 could be detected. Conventional corn harvested alongside MONS8017 with the same equipment showed a presence of transgenic plant material of around 0.5%. Analyses performed at two laboratories showed consistent and systematic differences in the concentrations of Cry3Bb1 measured with ELISA due to methodical differences.CONCLUSIONS: An extensive degradation of Cry3Bb1 was observed in silage despite differences in ELISA measurements. The potential risk associated with the use of MON88017 silage is discussed on this basis. (c) 2008 Society of Chemical Industry.

J		Article		Faunal and microbial diversity in three Welsh grassland soils under conventional and organic management regimes		Yeates, G. W.; Bardgett, R. D.; Cook, R.; Hobbs, P. J.; Bowling, P.

The economic success of organic farming depends upon enhancing natural processes in soil nutrient cycles. There are no reliable indicators of 'organic' grassland farming. 2. Paired conventionally and organically managed grasslands on silty, loamy and sandy soils were sampled in September 1994 to assess effects of management and soil texture on soil microbial and animal populations. 3. Microbial activity differed between management and sites, without consistent responses. 4. Bacterial and fungal phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) represented about one-third of extractable PLFA. Bacterial PLFA predominated and were unaffected by management except in silt, where there were more in organic grassland. Fungal PLFA were greater under organic management in all soils. 5. Tardigrada and Acari were more abundant under organic management; tardigrades were fewer in loam and Acari most abundant in sand. Lumbricid earthworm populations were smaller under organic managements at a sites. 6. Nematode populations were greater under organic grassland at all sites. Bacterial feeding nematodes were most abundant under organic grassland only in silt: individual taxa were affected differently by texture and management. Fungal-feeding nematodes were twice as abundant under organic managements at all sites: most taxa showed site x management interactions. Predacious nematodes were less common under organic management in silt and loam. Total plant-feeding nematodes were more abundant under organic management at all sites: individual taxa showed different responses, with texture often important. 7. Proportions of nematode trophic groups showed contrasting interactions with soil and management: only fungal-feeders responded consistently, there being a higher proportion in organic grassland in all soils. Nematodes regarded as K-strategists showed no site x management interactions, being more common in sand. Nematode population indices differed consistently between sites but not between management regimes. 8. Correlations were positive between bacterial PLFA and tardigrades and negative between microbial biomass and enchytraeids. Of nematodes only Cephalobidae were positively correlated with bacterial PLFA. Fungal-feeders were not correlated with fungal PLFA. 9. The responses to organic management were small in relation to those reported for arable cropping systems. There were some consistent responses, especially in cephalobid, fungal- and plant-feeding nematodes. It is likely that these are related to changes in soil nutrient cycling and diversity of soil biota. 10. It is recommended that assessment of the abundance of fungal-feeding nematodes in grassland soils be developed as an indicator of changes associated with the conversion from conventional to organic management regimes.

S		Book Chapter Meeting		The role of pasture improvement in the rehabilitation of the "montado/dehesa" system and in developing its traditional products		Crespo, D. G.			Ribeiro, JMCR; Horta, AEM; Mosconi, C; Rosati, A						Animal Products from the Mediterranean Area	EAAP European Association for Animal Production Publication	2006		119		185-195	185	195	English		International Symposium on Comparative Advantages for Typical Animal Products from the Mediterranean Area	Vale Santarem, PORTUGAL	September 25 -27, 2005	EAAP; CIHEAM Zaragoza; FAO	The "montado/dehesa", an old agro-sylvo-pastoral system, which predominates in the south-western semi-arid zone of the Iberian Peninsula, is formed by a beautifull open forest of cork and/or holm oaks, the soil being used by a long rotation of cereals and fallow natural pastures, which tend to be invaded by shrubs. Although the system is not highly productive on a per hectare basis, it produces a diversity of valuable traditional products, and provides feed and shelter for such a great number of domestic and wild animals, that it is considered one of the most interesting ecosystems in the world. However, the system is endangered by recent technological, economic and social changes which affected the rural society, particularly during the last 50 years. As a result large areas are being degraded, some have already disappeared, being urgent to find a sustainable solution to preserve the system. As most of degradation is associated with the abandon of cereal cultivation, accompanied by a shrub invasion of the natural pastures, and the reduction of feed resources for animal production, a sustainable solution to rehabilitate the system could rely on pasture improvement. A model of low cost permanent pasture improvement has been developed and widely demonstrated in Portugal and consists of establishing biodiverse legume-grass mixtures, the seeds of legumes being previously inoculated with specific Rhizobia, and the soil regularly fertilized with the missing nutrients, particularly phosphorus. These permanent legume-rich pastures have a great effect on soil fertility and on the carrying capacity of the land, which results in a considerable increase of the production of traditional products. At the same time, they contribute to arrest shrub invasion and facilitate the management of the system, thus reducing the costs of maintenance and increasing the income of the system.	Crespo, D.

J		Article		Defined areas for the cultivation of energy crops? Control options of planning	Gebietskulissen fur den Energiepflanzenanbau? Steuerungsmoglichkeiten der Planung	Schultze, Von Christian (Christian.Schultze@tu-berlin.de) ; Koeppel, Johann (koeppel@ile.tu-berlin.de)									Naturschutz und Landschaftsplanung		2007	SEP 2007	39	9	269-272	269	272	German						In some regions of Germany the expanded cultivation of energy is significantly increasing impacts on natural resources leading to risks for natural and environmental protection. So far, planning has had no serious influence on the control of these land use dynamics.It could be a solution to derive relevant regions for the protection of natural ressources on the base of area-wide landscape analyses. The considerations of the paper presented suggest to distinguish and outline suitable areas in landscape planning or land use planning, where the the cultivation of energy crops is to be promoted, similar to the bonus system according to the Renewable Energy Law.Experiences on the definition of areas in connection with the Renewable Energy Law already exist in the field of wind power use in the planning regions. A region-specific promotion could offer the possibility to spatially control economic incentives for the cultivation of biomass and at the same time relieve more sensitive areas by avoiding the partly intensive cultivation of energy crops. In the end, responsibility for the definition of the suitable areas would remain with the region.The approaches discussed in the paper consider the options of an amendment of the Renewable Energy Law. The linking of the defined areas with other steering tools of promotion law in the field of biomass provision could also be strived for, in order to not only integrate the energy crops according to the Renewable Energy Law, but also cultivations for the production of heat, fuel as well as for material use.

J		Article		Comparison of farming techniques actually implemented and their rationality in organic and conventional olive groves in Andalusia, Spain		Parra-Lopez, C.; Calatrava-Requena, J. (carparra@teleline.es)									Biological Agriculture & Horticulture		2006		24	1	35-59	35	59	English						This paper compares the degree of actual implementation of different farming techniques used by organic and conventional olive growers in Andalusia (a region in the south of Spain) as a means to achieve a twofold objective. On the one hand, the aim is to assess if the analysed farming techniques are significantly different between both types of olive growers and whether their implementation is widespread. On the other hand, it is necessary to establish whether the aforesaid techniques can be considered to be the best possible options from an environmental, economic and/or agronomic point of view. The analysis has taken into account many relevant techniques in olive growing so that planting, soil management, irrigation, fertilization, phytosanitation, harvesting, transport and pruning have all been studied. Results show how in organic farming, in almost all the cases, more appropriate techniques from an environmental, economic and/or agronomic perspective are being used than in conventional farming. However, there is still a long way ahead until the optimal techniques are the trend in both types of production systems. In this sense organic agriculture must be ahead of conventional and other alternative forms of agriculture to prove and increase its superior value to society. Organic farming regulations should better define obligatory, recommended and forbidden organic practices, for each crop cultivated and in as local a context as possible, and so overcome the present lack of regulation of some technical aspects, prevent the diffusion of undesired agricultural practices and encourage implementation of sustainable and rational ones.

Avian Diseases		2006	JUN 2006	50	2	196-200	196	200	English						The purpose of the present cross-sectional study was to evaluate the health status of organic broiler chickens and the contamination rate with Salmonella and Campylobacter in organic broiler production in Belgium. The broilers were screened for antibodies against routinely monitored poultry diseases at I day old and at slaughter. Fecal examination for the presence of worm eggs was done at slaughter. Bacteriological examination for the detection of Salmonella and Campylobacter was performed at day 1, week 2, week 4, week 7, week 10, and slaughter. Conventional broilers of the same poultry integration and reared in the same geographic area were also screened and served as reference. Serologic data indicated lower antibody titers against infectious bronchitis and Newcastle disease in organic flocks. No significant differences could be found in prevalence of Salmonella between organic and conventional broilers at slaughter. In contrast, Campylobacter infections at slaughter were significantly higher in organic flocks. Organic flocks most probably become infected with Campylobacter between week 7 and week 10. Worm eggs were found in neither the organic flocks nor the conventional flocks. In conclusion, there are indications that the respiratory health status is better in organic broilers but that organic flocks are more often infected with Campylobacter than are conventional flocks.

J		Article		The effect of arbuscular mycorrhiza on biomass production and phosphorus uptake from sparingly soluble sources by leek (Allium porrum L.) in Finnish field soils		Kahiluoto, Helena; Vestberg, Mauritz									Biological Agriculture and Horticulture		1998		16	1	65-85	65	85	English	print					The effect of inoculation by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and indigenous AMF populations on biomass production and phosphorus (P) uptake by leek and on its utilization of P in Kola apatite and bone meat was studied in field soils. Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) did not enhance P uptake from Kola apatite, which had no clear effect on P uptake by leek within one growing season, either in the field or in pots. AM increased P uptake from bone meal by 62% in a pot experiment. Inoculation did not increase the effect in unsterile soil as compared with the indigenous AMF populations. The results demonstrate a key role for AM in utilization of organic P. On conventionally managed soil monocropped with cereal, inoculation increased growth and P uptake by leek by 62 and 73%, respectively, in contrast to organically cultivated soil where it had a slight negative effect, The difference in the inoculation effect was concluded to be due to the more abundant and effective indigenous AMF populations in the organically cultivated soil. This was suggested by the fourfold higher spore density at the start of the trials and larger root colonization in the organic cropping system as well as by the fact that the inoculation effect was not dependent on fertilization. Superphosphate application in the conventional system resulted in soil P availability comparable to that in the organic system. Management history was the only important factor influencing AM effectiveness which was different on the two experimental sites. The results suggested that regular inoculation is not an appropriate AM utilization strategy in a sustainable farming system. The hypothesis for further study is that utilization of the indigenous AMF by system management would have more potential in sustainable agricultural practices.	Kahiluoto, Helena; Agric. Res.

Investigacion Agraria Produccion y Proteccion Vegetales		2001	Agosto, 2001	16	2	257-272	257	272	Spanish	print					Fruit epiphyte and environmental fungal populations were examined in "Clemenules" orchards in Baix Ebre and Montsia areas (Tarragona, Spain). For two consecutive seasons, sampling was conducted twice (from September to December and from January to March) in four representative commercial orchards and in an organic orchard. Cladosporium was the most frequent genus present (89.8% and 80.4% of colonies isolated from the fruit surface at the first and second sampling, respectively; and 72.1% and 32.7% of colonies isolated from the environment at the first and second sampling, respectively). Pathogenic fungi like Penicillium, Alternaria, or Rhizopus were more frequently isolated in the second sampling (8.4% and 25.9% of Penicillium colonies from the fruit surface and the environment, respectively) than in the first sampling (1.2% and 0.6% of Penicillium colonies from the fruit surface and the environment, respectively). Both total fungal population and Penicillium population were found to be highly variable, with significant interactions among years, samplings and orchards. Total fungal population was highly correlated with temperature (r > 0.9). Environmental population, but not fruit epiphyte population, was higher in the organic orchard than in the commercial ones.

J		Article		Fungi in Danish soils under organic and conventional farming		Elmholt, Susanne (susanne.elmholt@agrsci.dk) ; Labouriau, Rodrigo									Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment		2005	MAY 2 05	107	1	65-73	65	73	English						A multi-soil study was conducted in Denmark including 29 sites, 8 classified as 'organic', 11 as 'conventional with manure and synthetic fertilisers' and 10 as, 'conventional with synthetic fertilisers'. The variability of fungal abundance within the three farming systems and the long-term effects of different farming systems on fungal propagules in soil were evaluated.Fungal abundance showed large variations within all three farming systems and this variability reduced the possibility to obtain general conclusions on fungal composition in soils under different farming systems. This was illustrated by the results on total propagule numbers of filamentous fungi and yeasts. Penicillium spp. and Gliocladium roseum were more abundant under organic than conventional farming, while Trichoderma spp. were most abundant in conventionally farmed soils with synthetic fertilisers. These results were not altered after adjusting for possible differences in basic soil properties like total C and N, extractable P, CEC, base saturation and soil density. The paper discusses whether the differences in fungal abundance are characteristics of a fanning system itself or associated with certain management factors being more prevalent in one farming system than the other.

J		Article	Literature Review	Welfare, health and product quality in organic beef production: a Danish perspective		Nielsen, B. K. (b.nielsen@norfeed.dk) ; Thamsborg, S. M.									Livestock Production Science		2005	JUN 2005	94	1-2, Sp. Iss. SI	41-50	41	50	English						In Europe, organic beef production is based on grazing in summer and feeding a minimum of 60% roughage during the whole year. Although these recommendations were intended to improve animal health and welfare, several factors may cause problems in organic beef production systems. This paper gives an overview of welfare, health and product quality in organic beef production, with emphasis on organic steer production based on dairy-breed bull calves. A short overview of different production systems, highlighting the effect on health and welfare, is also given. Feeding aspects are discussed. Farm studies have shown that organic steer production involves large amounts of roughage; only small quantities of cereals are used compared to conventional production of bulls and calves. Fattening of organic steers may result in metabolic disorders due to sudden changes in the feed ration when changing from high roughage to high cereal content. Various problems relating to the production system are discussed. Subjective monthly observations indicate a good level of general health and welfare in organic steer production systems. On pasture, parasitic infection is the primary factor affecting animal health and productivity of organic beef. Rearing of young calves and the utilization of marginal grazing areas requires further attention. The effect of castration on health and welfare, and the effect of castration age and method, are also discussed. Product quality of organic beef is affected by the production system, especially sex, grazing and exercise. Grazing and exercise, which are inevitable components of an organic beef production system, may affect the eating quality due to darker meat color, risk of off-flavor, yellow fat, and a higher content of unsaturated fatty acids, including conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). Nevertheless, the overall effect on sensory attributes may be of minor importance. For the future, feeding large amounts of roughage, combined with a high bioactive forage content, could be one way of improving the product quality of organic beef.

(karin.schwaiger@wzw.tum.de) ; Schmied, E. -M. V.; Bauer, J.									Zoonoses and Public Health		2008	SEP 2008	55	7	331-341	331	341	English						By investigating the prevalence and resistance characteristics of Gram-negative bacteria from organic and conventional kept laying hens against 31 (Campylobacter: 29) different antibiotics using the microdilution method, we determined to what extent different keeping systems influence bacterial resistance patterns. For this purpose, samples from 10 organic and 10 conventional flocks in Bavaria (Germany) were investigated four times between January 2004 and April 2005. Altogether, 799 cloacal swabs and 800 eggs (contents and shells) were examined. The bacterial investigation performed with standardized cultural methods showed prevalence for all bacteria groups in about the same order of magnitude in the two different keeping systems: Salmonella spp. 3.5% (organic ([org])) versus 1.8% (conventional ([con])); Campylobacter spp. 34.8%(org) versus 29.0%(con) and E. coli 64.4%(org) versus 69.0%(con). Coliforms (Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Pantoea) were only isolated in single cases. In eggs, generally less bacteria were detected, predominantly Escherichia; Salmonella and Campylobacter were only scarcely isolated. Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (n = 10) were resistant to up to nine, S. of the serogroup B (n = 4) up to six antibiotics. All tested Salmonella (n = 23) proved to be resistant to spectinomycin. Escherichia coli (n = 257(org) and 276(con)) from organic layers showed significant lower resistance rates and higher rates of susceptible isolates to nine agents, namely amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefaclor, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, doxycycline, mezlocillin, neomycin and piperacillin. In contrast, only two antibiotics turned out to be more effective in conventional isolates (gentamicin and tobramycin). In the case of Campylobacter jejuni (n = 118(org) and 99(con)), statistically significantly better rates were observed for isolates from organic flocks concerning imipenem and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, whereas fosfomycin was more potent in strains from conventional flocks. Results of this study indicate that both resistance rates and mean minimum inhibitory concentrations of bacteria isolated from organic keeping systems have lower values than those from conventional ones, particularly recognizable for E. coli. Thus, organic livestock farming with its restrictions and additional requirements contributes to further effectiveness of antibiotics.

Oceanology		2008	APR 2008	48	2	228-232	228	232	English						Structural and functional parameters of planktonic and benthic communities in the White Sea were studied both at the sites of industrial mussel cultivation farms (MF) and in aquaculture free areas. Redistribution of organic matter in pelagic and bottom systems close to MF was shown to result in changes of the structure of the surrounding biocoenoses. The consumption of proteins by mussels led to a drastic decrease in the relative abundance of planktonic bacteria, while the composition and abundance of the zooplanktonic community were not affected by MF. A significantly uneven distribution was found in the bottom habitats, which results in organic contamination and, in some cases, in degradation of benthic communities.	Primakov, I.

J		Article		Carbon dynamics determined by natural 13C abundance in microcosm experiments with soils from long-term maize and rye monocultures.		John, Bettina (bjohn@gwdg.de) ; Ludwig, Bernard; Flessa, Heiner									Soil Biology & Biochemistry		2003	September 2003	35	9	1193-1202	1193	1202	English	print					Understanding carbon dynamics in soil is the key to managing soil organic matter. Our objective was to quantify the carbon dynamics in microcosm experiments with soils from long-term rye and maize monocultures using natural 13C abundance. Microcosms with undisturbed soil columns from the surface soil (0-25 cm) and subsoil (25-50 cm) of plots cultivated with rye (C3-plant) since 1878 and maize (C4-plant) since 1961 with and without NPK fertilization from the long-term experiment 'Ewiger Roggen' in Halle, Germany, were incubated for 230 days at 8 degreeC and irrigated with 2 mm 10-2 M CaCl2 per day. Younger, C4-derived and older, C3-derived percentages of soil organic carbon (SOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass (Cmic) and CO2 from heterothropic respiration were determined by natural 13C abundance. The percentage of maize-derived carbon was highest in CO2 (42-79%), followed by Cmic (23-46%), DOC (5-30%) and SOC (5-14%) in the surface soils and subsoils of the maize plots. The percentage of maize-derived C was higher for the NPK plot than for the unfertilized plot and higher for the surface soils than for the subsoils. Specific production rates of DOC, CO2-C and Cmic from the maize-derived SOC were 0.06-0.08% for DOC, 1.6-2.6% for CO2-C and 1.9-2.7% for Cmic, respectively, and specific production rates from rye-derived SOC of the continuous maize plot were 0.03-0.05% for DOC, 0.1-0.2% for CO2-C and 0.3-0.5% for Cmic. NPK fertilization did not affect the specific production rates. Strong correlations were found between C4-derived Cmic and C4-derived SOC, DOC and CO2-C (r > 0.90), whereas the relationship between C3-derived Cmic and C3-derived SOC, DOC and CO2-C was not as pronounced (r ltoreq 0.67). The results stress the different importance of former (older than 40 years) and recent (younger than 40 years) litter C inputs for the formation of different C pools in the soil.

J		Article		The effect of urea and pig slurry fertilization on denitrification, direct nitrous oxide emission, volatile fatty acids, water-soluble carbon and anthrone-reactive carbon in maize-cropped soil from the Po plain (Modena, Italy)		Arcara, P. G.; Gamba, C.; Bidini, D.; Marchetti, R.									Biology and Fertility of Soils		1999	July, 1999	29	3	270-276	270	276	English	print					The use of zootechnical slurries in agriculture can increase N losses as N2O by direct emission and by denitrification. The aim of this research was to determine the influence of pig slurry, as well as its combination with mineral N, on N2O emissions in the field and their relationships with some fractions of soil organic matter, with soil moisture and with rainfall. In spite of varying amounts of organic substance applied, the diverse agronomic treatments did not produce substantial differences in N losses due to denitrification. Wide variations between the slurry fertilized and the urea-fertilized plots were not found, whereas the combination of pig slurry with urea usually produced an increase both in N2O emissions due to denitrification and in direct N2O emissions (N losses corresponding to about 50% of those due to denitrification). The greatest losses of N2O-N occurred in the first month following fertilizer administration. N2O emissions due to denitrification were highestin the days immediately following the administration of fertilizers and lowest in a later period. N2O emissions due to nitrification occurred later. Therefore, N2O emission via nitrification differed from N2O losses via denitrification which, under optimal conditions, presented peaks of activity during the whole growth cycle. The N2O-N losses were highly influenced by physical parameters, particularly rain. An increase in micropore water creates conditions of scarce oxygenation or of anaerobiosis which influence oxidation-reduction processes and, at the same time, can limit the diffusion of bacteria-produced gas towards the soil surface.

Letters in Applied Microbiology		2005		41	2	186-189	186	189	English						Aim: To investigate bacteriological quality in organically grown leaf lettuce, including the presence of selected pathogenic bacteria, and to obtain information about organic lettuce production, including fertilizing regimes.Methods and Results: Altogether 179 samples of Norwegian organically grown lettuce were collected from 12 producers. Escherichia coli was isolated from 16 of the lettuce samples, but in 12 of these contamination was sufficiently low (< 100 CFU g(-1)) that they would be considered to be of acceptable bacteriological quality. Escherichia coli O157 and Salmonella were not detected in any of the samples. Listeria monocytogenes serogroups 1 and 4 were isolated from two samples.Conclusions: Organic lettuce produced in Norway was generally of acceptable bacteriological quality, but the results show that contamination of organic lettuce with E. coli and L. monocytogenes do occasionally occur.Significance and Impact of the Study: These results suggest that organically grown lettuce may be contaminated with E. coli and L. monocytogenes during cultivation.

Previous studies have shown the importance of functional biodiversity for soil organisms. 2. Soil samples have been collected within the framework of a long-term monitoring programme in the Netherlands. Nematological and microbiological techniques were combined to facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of possible below-ground effects of land management. 3. A possible bias due to stochastic circumstances was investigated. The Mantel test showed that the diversity at species level is largely related to air temperature, but at genus level the effect of temperature disappears. No direct influence of rainfall on the soil biodiversity was found in our model. 4. To extrapolate our data to a national level, habitat-response relationships for soil organisms have been derived. Generalized linear models (GLMs) and Monte Carlo simulation allowed the estimation of the probability of occurrence at a given abundance for 95 nematode genera. 5. Our study describes the influence of abiotic conditions and land use intensity on the composition of nematode communities in grasslands on sand. The results obtained reveal a major influence of pH and livestock density on the diversity of the nematode community at both taxonomic levels as well as at different trophic levels (feeding habits). The presence and abundance of soil nematodes decrease with cattle pressure. 6. Functional diversity decreases with increasing management intensity. It is shown that the Shannon diversities of bacterial feeding nematodes and fungal feeding nematodes are strictly related to cattle pressure, whereas the bacterial biomass occurring under organic farming scores higher than in other farming systems.

J		Article		Carbohydrate composition in relation to structural stability, compactibility and plasticity of two soils in a long-term experiment		Ball, B. C.; Cheshire, M. V.; Robertson, E. A. G.; Hunter, E. A.									Soil and Tillage Research		1996		39	3-4	142-160	142	160	English						The effects of tillage on soil organic carbon content, carbohydrate content, monosaccharide composition, aggregate stability, compactibility and plasticity were investigated in a field experiment on a gleysol and on a cambisol under winter barley in South-East Scotland. Two long-term treatments (direct drilling and conventional mouldboard ploughing for 22 years) were compared with short-term direct drilling and broadcast sowing plus rotavation for 5 years. Carbohydrate released sequentially to cold water, hot water, 1.0 M HCl and 0.5 M NaOH was determined after hydrolysis as reducing sugar equivalent to glucose in both fresh and air-dried samples. All other measurements were made on dry soils only. About 38 of the soluble carbohydrate was extracted by cold water, 10% by hot water, 12% by HCl and 75% by NaOH from both the dry and fresh soils. The total reducing sugars of the fractions were proportional to the total organic carbon determined by dichromate oxidation or C analysis. Organic carbon and carbohydrates were concentrated near the surface of the direct drilled soil, but were mon uniformly distributed with depth in the ploughed soil. The surface soil under direct drilling was more stable, less compactible and had greater plasticity limits than under ploughing. However, particle size distributions were unaffected by tillage so that differences in soil properties were attributed to differences in the quantity and quality of organic matter. Differences in compactibility, structural stability and plasticity limits between depths and tillage treatments correlated with total carbon and with total carbohydrates. The hot water extractable carbohydrate fraction correlated best with aggregate stability and the NaOH fraction correlated best with compactibility and plastic limit. Both fractions were greatest in the long-term direct drilled soil. The hot water fraction had a galactose plus mannose over arabinose plus xylose ratio of 1.0-1.6 in comparison to 0.4-0.7 in the NaOH fraction indicating that the microbial contribution within the hot water-soluble fraction was the greater. The hot-water fraction was likely to contain more exocellular microbial polysaccharides involved in the stabilizing of soil aggregates. The hot-water and NaOH carbohydrate fractions may be good indicators of soil organic matter quality relevant to the preservation of good soil physical conditions.	Ball, B.

There was a relationship between occurrence of microorganisms and the basin management method. The greatest concentration of keratinophilic fungi where species typical of sewages polluted with them dominated was found in sediments of a basin used for recreation. In sediments of a lake located in the agricultural region there was a domination of species characteristic of pure water in respect to sanitary regulations.	Dep. Microbiol., Agric.

J		Article		Soil meso- and macrofauna in two agricultural systems: Factors affecting population dynamics and evaluation of their role in carbon and nitrogen dynamics		Didden, W. A. M.; Marinissen, J. C. Y.; Vreeken-Buijs, M. J.; Burgers, S. L. G. E.; De Fluiter, R.; Geurs, M.; Brussaard, L.									Agriculture Ecosystems and Environment		1994		51	1-2	171-186	171	186	English						Data on soil meso- and macrofauna from winter wheat fields in the Netherlands under conventional and integrated management were analysed to explain their population dynamics and to evaluate their contribution to carbon and nitrogen dynamics. To compare the functioning of the soil fauna in both systems, respiration and mineralization were calculated on a daily basis, and canonical correspondence analysis was used to analyse the response of soil fauna to abiotic factors and to biotic factors of the previous sample date. Mainly because of the occurrence of earthworms, which were absent in the conventional system, soil fauna was clearly more important in the integrated system: integrated/conventional ratios of biomass and respiration were 58.43 and 6.49, respectively for soil meso- and macrofauna. An indication of a shift of bacterivorous to fungivorous fauna was found in the integrated system under the assumption that earthworms were 80% microbivorous and 20% saprophagous, but not when it was assumed that they were 100% saprophagous. It was calculated that meso- and macrofauna mineralized 3.3 kg N ha-1 year-1 in the conventional and 39.8 kg N ha-1 year-1 in the integrated system, or 4.3% and 39.4% of the total in situ mineralization, respectively. Total faunal mineralization was 49.1% and 86.6% of the total in situ mineralization in conventional and integrated systems, respectively. It was found that in both systems, seasonal factors played an important role in explaining biomass dynamics and that in the course of time, the upper layer in the integrated system increased in importance. It appeared from the analyses that food relations may differ in the two systems, with probably more complicated and diverse relations occurring in the integrated system. Analysis of the results of this study in comparison with the results of a food web approach showed general agreement; the largest deviations occurred on lower trophic levels, which may be associated with the greater sensitivity of the food web approach to the accuracy of parameter estimates.

European Journal of Soil Science		2007	FEB 2007	58	1	83-91	83	91	English						Changes in land use and fire directly affect the physico-chemical properties of the soil. In an eastern Spanish area, we analysed the effects of land-use history and fire frequency prior to fire on soil fertility 9 years after fire. The results showed that long-term cultivation caused decreases in soil organic matter, total nitrogen (N) and C/N. Between 20 and 40 years after cropping ceased, soil organic carbon (C) and total N had generally not recovered values similar to those found in soils that were never cropped. Total phosphorus and available phosphorus contents were larger in the latest abandoned plots than in the earliest abandoned plots and the uncropped ones, which was interpreted as a result of fertilization. Increasing fire frequency from one to two fires generally caused a decrease in soil organic C, total N, C/N, total phosphorus and available phosphorus. We observed that the losses of organic C in the soil caused by fire were larger among the uncropped plots and hypothesized that fuel loads and thus fire intensities were larger in these ecosystems. Our results also suggested that both long-term cultivation and fire would tend to separate C and P cycles.	Duguy, B.; CEAM, Parc Tecnol,C Charles Darwin 14, Valencia 46980, Spain		Vallejo, V.

B		Book Chapter		Explaining Farmer Demand for Agricultural Biodiversity in Hungary's Transition Economy		Birol, E.; Smale, M.; Gyovai, A.			Smale, M						Valuing Crop Biodiversity: On-farm Genetic Resources and Economic Change		2006				119-145	119	145	English						In this chapter, a household farm model is used to predict farmer demand for four components of the agricultural biodiversity found on family farms in Hungary. Family farms in Hungary are known traditionally as 'home gardens'. The analysis is based on survey data from the same sites studied in Chapters 3 and 15, which use stated preference and institutional approaches. The four components analysed are: (i) richness in crops and varieties (crop variety diversity); (ii) cultivation of landraces, as compared to modern varieties (crop genetic diversity); (iii) integration of crop and livestock production (agrodiversity); and (iv) use of organic production methods (soil microorganism diversity). The econometric model is based on the approach presented in Chapter 5, specified in different ways to reflect the definition of the dependent variable. Farm households who are most likely to sustain observed levels of agricultural biodiversity are described statistically. The stratified sample design lends insights into the potential impact of economic transition on the prospects for conserving agricultural biodiversity. Findings can assist those who formulate agri-environmental policy in Hungary to design efficient programmes that incorporate home garden management.

Grass and Forage Science		2004	June 2004	59	2	169-179	169	179	English	print					The effects of changes from conventional grassland management on fenland in Germany to extensification due to reduced fertilizer inputs and cutting frequency on the microbial colonization in the phyllosphere were investigated. A delay in the first cut for silage and hay, required by a nature conservation programme, was accompanied by the senescence of grasses which significantly influenced certain microbial groups. Heterotrophic bacteria, aerobic and anaerobic spore-formers, as well as filamentous fungi, showed an increase in population densities on the mature herbage of the later cuts. Differences in the rate of fertilizer application and cutting frequency, which had an effect on the dry-matter yield, also influenced the population density of heterotrophic bacteria and, in certain circumstances, that of filamentous fungi. Chemical measures of forage quality were highly correlated with the population density of microbial groups and with the maturity of the herbage. In contrast to these results, the population dynamics of further groups of micro-organisms (yeasts, Micrococcaceae, listeria) did not show any relationship with pasture management.

J		Article		Aspects of carbon and nitrogen cycling in soils of the Bornhoved Lake district: II. Modelling the influence of temperature increase on soil respiration and organic carbon content in arable soils under different managements		Kutsch, Werner; Kappen, Ludger									Biogeochemistry (Dordrecht)		1997		39	2	207-224	207	224	English						Based on field measurements in two agricultural ecosystems, soil respiration and long-term response of soil organic carbon content (SOC) was modelled. The model predicts the influence of temperature increase as well as the effects of land-use over a period of thirty years in a northern German glacial moraine landscape. One of the fields carried a maize monoculture treated with cattle slurry in addition to mineral fertilizer ("maize monoculture"), the other was managed by crop rotation and received organic manure ("crop rotation"). The soils of both fields were classified as cambic Arenosols. The soil respiration was measured in the fields by means of the open dynamic inverted-box method and an infrared gas analyser. The mean annual soil respiration rates were 268 (maize monoculture) and 287 Mg CO-2 m-2 h-1 (crop rotation). Factors controlling soil respiration were soil temperature, soil moisture, root respiration and carbon input into the soil. Q-10-values of soil respiration were generally higher in winter than in summer. This trend is interpreted as an adaptive response of the soil microbial communities. In the model a novel mathematical approach with variable Q-10-values as a result of temperature and moisture adjustment is proposed, With the calibrated model soil respiration and SOC were calculated for both fields and simulations over a period of thirty years were established. Simulations were based on (1) local climatic data, 1961 until 1990, and (2) a regional climate scenario for northern Germany with an average temperature increase of 2.1 K. Over the thirty years period with present climate conditions, the SOC pool under "crop rotation" was nearly stable due to the higher carbon inputs, whereas about 16 t C ha-1 were lost under "maize monoculture". Under global warming the mean annual soil respiration for both fields increased and SOC decreased by ca. 10 t C ha-1 under "crop rotation" and by more than 20 t C ha-1 under "maize monoculture". It was shown that overestimation of carbon losses in long-term prognoses can be avoided by including a Q-10-adjustment in soil respiration models.	Kutsch, Werner; Oekologiezentrum, Univ.

J		Article		Study of the occurrence of greenhouse microfungi in a Botanical Garden.		Rodolfi, M.; Lorenzi, E.; Picco, A. M. (apicco@et.unipv.it)									Journal of Phytopathology (Berlin)		2003	November-December 2003	151	11-12	591-599	591	599	English	print					Three greenhouses and the Central Garden of The Botanical Garden of Pavia were monitored for 1 year with the objective of investigating the occurrence of both airborne fungal spores and phylloplane fungi. By using an SAS air sampler, the higher fungal spore concentrations were detected in tropical and Mediterranean greenhouses. A total of 72 species belonging to 42 genera, some of which are related to the presence of plants ex situ, were isolated from Petri plates after exposure. Some airborne fungi, such as Aspergillus spp., Penicillium spp. and Conidiobolus spp., which are responsible for human allergies and respiratory problems, were also detected. Forty-four genera of phylloplane fungi were identified from leaves randomly collected from greenhouse plants. Most of the aerial fungal taxa isolated were also detected from the phylloplane. Some phytopathogenic taxa, as exemplified by Gliocladium vermoeseni, Graphium sp., Peronospora sp., and Zygosporium oscheoides, were isolated only from the phylloplane. The information obtained from qualitative and quantitative analysis of fungi can be a useful tool in the control of indoor air quality, thereby guaranteeing ex situ plant conservation and occupational health safety.

These cornflake samples, originating from conventional as well as from organic production, were analyzed using an intralaboratory-validated LC-MS/MS method. Additionally, 90 cornflake samples were subjected to rapid screening using a flow-through enzyme immunoassay method to demonstrate the practicability of a screening test coupled to a validated confirmatory LC-MS/MS method for the management of food safety risks. FB1 concentrations ranged from not detected (nd) [LOD (FB1) = 20 mu g/kg] to 464 mu g/kg with mean and median concentrations of respectively 104 +/- 113 and 54 mu g/kg. For FB2 and FB3, the concentration ranges varied respectively from nd [LOD (FB2) = 7.5 mu g/kg] to 43 mu g/kg and from nd [LOD (FB3) = 12.5 mu g/kg] to 90 mu g/kg. Mean concentrations for FB2 and FB3 were respectively 12 +/- 8 and 21 +/- 15 mu g/kg, while the median concentration was 11 mu g/kg for FB2 and 19 mu g/kg for FB3. From the statistical tests (chi(2) and ANOVA model III), it could be concluded that the agricultural practice did not have any significant effect on the fumonisin concentrations but that the variation between different batches was significant (p < 0.0001).

J		Article		Occurrence and importance of plant-parasitic nematodes in organic farming in Germany		Hallmann, Johannes (j.hallmann@bba.de) ; Frankenberg, Andrea; Paffrath, Andreas; Schmidt, Harald									Nematology		2007	NOV 2007	9	Part 6	869-879	869	879	English						In an attempt to evaluate the occurrence and economic importance of plant-parasitic nematodes in organic farming in Germany, a survey was conducted with the main emphasis on vegetable and cereal production systems. For vegetables, the survey included quantification and identification of plant-parasitic nematodes in soil samples and a questionnaire for growers querying production factors and damage levels. For cereals, the survey focused on quantification and identification of plant-parasitic nematodes in soil and plant samples. Overall, Pratylenchus and Tylenchorhynchus were the most prominent nematode genera under both production systems with an incidence of over 90% of the samples. Meloidogyne was detected in 51% of the samples in both systems. Other nematode genera showed differences between the two production systems. In production systems with a high frequency of vegetables, Paratylenchus was detected in 56% of the samples and Heterodera in 15%, whereas in rotations with a high cropping frequency of cereals, incidences of plant-parasitic nematodes were 56% for Heterodera, 47% for Trichodorus and 45% for Paratylenchus. Yield losses could exceed 50% on carrots, onions and cereals and were most pronounced on sandy soils. In many cases, nematode problems started 5 to 10 years after conversion to organic farming. The survey indicated that plant-parasitic nematodes are widely spread in organic farming in Germany and can cause severe damage which may result in complete loss of the crop.

J		Article		Exploring the ancient occupation of a high altitude site (Lake Lauzon, France): Comparison between pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs		Argant, Jacqueline (j.argant@wanadoo.fr) ; Lopez-Saez, Jose Antonio (alopez@ih.esic.es) ; Bintz, Pierre (pbintz@ujf-grenoble.fr)									Review of Palaeobotany & Palynology		2006	AUG 2006	141	1-2	151-163	151	163	English						Next to Lus-la-Croix-Haute (Southern Alps, Drome, France), Lake Lauzon is located in a small basin 1980 in above sea level, 500 in above the actual timberline, in the middle of typical sub-alpine grasslands. A drilling for samples in the wetland area bordering the lake made it possible to obtain a core of clayey fine sediments with a high organic matter content, in which pollen as well as many micro-organ isms had been particularly well preserved. The pollen analysis and the non-pollen palynomorhs analysis both cover a period from ca. 8000 cal. BP to sub-recent time. The pollen analysis reveals the presence of a thriving forest vegetation dominated by Abies, and the first signs of human activity near the lake and its nearby basins in the Atlantic period. These signs become more pronounced during the Sub-boreal period from 5450 cal. BP on, with the clear presence of cereal and weed pollen. This evolution is totally confirmed by the non-pollen palynomorphs. Since the Neolithic, every time pollen analysis points to clearings or cultivation, the non-pollen palynomorphs indicate that man has burnt the vegetation to obtain openings (occurrence of Chaetomium sp.). Increased erosion during the Sub-atlantic period is revealed by the occurrence of Glomus cf. fasciculatum. Furthermore, non-pollen palynomorphs give information on eutrophication of the lake which may be explained by more nutrient-rich habitats around the lake due to grazing and possibly agriculture. The combination of both types of analysis makes it possible to prove that this elevated site has been occupied and cleared at an early stage by man to obtain pasture lands and possibly arable land. This led to deforestation, which increased during the Sub-atlantic period, and has led to the present grasslands. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J		Article		Review: Natural enemies and biocontrol of pests of strawberry in northern and central Europe		Cross, J. V.; Easterbrook, M. A.; Crook, A. M.; Crook, D.; Fitzgerald, J. D.; Innocenzi, P. J.; Jay, C. N.; Solomon, M. G.									Biocontrol Science and Technology		2001	April, 2001	11	2	165-216	165	216	English	print					The natural enemies of the more important arthropod, nematode and mollusc pests of strawberry in northern and central Europe and their use as biocontrol agents are reviewed. Most pests of strawberry are polyphagous and they and their natural enemies occur on other host plants (especially Rosaceae) as well as on other crops. Strawberry cultivation methods, including protected cultivation and other methods of extending the fruiting season, soil sterilization, polythene mulching and pesticide spray programmes have profound influences on the pest and natural enemy complex, though such effects have not been quantified adequately. All the pests of strawberry reviewed have natural enemies, though some pests (e.g. capsid bugs) have few. A few natural enemy groups are known to act as important natural limiting factors in pest population development in commercial strawberry crops. Two examples are naturally-occurring phytoseiid predatory mites which regulate pest mite populations, and predatory carabid beetles which regulate root weevil populations. Apart from the introduction of predatory phytoseiid mites to control two-spotted spider mite, biocontrol is not widely used in commercial practice. Other biocontrol approaches are known to be efficacious, but are too costly in comparison with conventional insecticides for commercial adoption (e.g. nematodes for slug control). Several biocontrol approaches have been researched and have potential for further development and exploitation and there is considerable opportunity to develop new approaches. Research effort should concentrate on those for common pests, which are controlled currently by frequent sprays of broad-spectrum insecticides, e.g. aphids, blossom weevil, capsids and vine weevil. As strawberry is often grown as an annual or short-term perennial crop, exploiting natural populations of natural enemies is difficult. More effort needs to be devoted to the development of microbial and nematode biocontrol agents, which can be used as biopesticides. Protected cultivation of strawberry provides more favourable conditions for exploitation of biocontrol including introduction of insect predators and parasites.	Cross, J.

Weed Research		1996		36	2	105-112	105	112	English						The metabolism of atrazine in soil was studied in two maize fields located in regions with different soil types. Treatments were cow manure or pig slurry (50 tonnes each ha-1) applied once either in March or in November before sowing, or green manure incorporated in March. Control plots were not treated with organic fertilizers. Atrazine at 0.75 or 1.0 kg a.i. ha-1 was applied after sowing. In the 0-12 cm sod layer, the main atrazine metabolites found were deethylatrazine and hydroxyatrazine. Low concentrations of deisopropylatrazine and 6-chloro-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine were also observed. During the 4 months after sowing, the organic fertilizers decreased the rate of atrazine degradation, but subsequently there were no differences between treated and control plots. At harvest, the concentrations of atrazine and its metabolites were very low and similar in all plots. The organic fertilizers thus did not cause atrazine metabolites to accumulate in soil. In addition, atrazine and its metabolites were never detected below 12 cm in any of the plots.	Rouchaud, J.; Gustin, F.; Lab. Phytopharmacy, Univ.

Long-term application of organic amendment did not modify atrazine-mineralizing activity, which was found to essentially depend oil the soil type. It also did not modify atrazine-degrading genetic potential estimated by quantitative PCR targeting atzA, B and C genes. which was shown to depend on soil type. The structure of soil bacterial community determined by RISA fingerprinting was significantly affected by organic amendment. These results showed that modification of the structure of soil bacterial community in response to organic amendment is not necessarily accompanied by a modification of atrazine-degrading genetic potential or activity. In addition, these results revealed that different soils showing similar atrazine-degrading genetic potentials may exhibit different atrazine-degrading activities.

J		Article		Cultivation of black truffle to promote reforestation and land-use stability		Bonet, J. A.; Fischer, C. R. (christine.fischer@ctfc.es) ; Colinas, C.									Agronomy for Sustainable Development		2006	JAN-MAR 2006	26	1	69-76	69	76	English						Cultivation of black truffle, Tuber melanosporum Vitt., has become an important agricultural alternative in rural Mediterranean regions due to its success in relatively harsh conditions, its high market value and diminishing production in natural areas. In addition, truffle cultivation requires relatively low agricultural inputs, promotes reforestation and economic restoration of rural lands and land-use stability. However, there remain major issues regarding the management practices to ensure successful black truffle production. We therefore conducted an experiment to evaluate 3 levels of irrigation based on monthly water deficit and the effects of currently applied weed control systems and fertilization. Treatment effects were evaluated by examining the mycorrhizal status of out-planted 1-yr-old Quercus ilex L. seedlings and seedling growth parameters after 18 months in 3 distinct experimental truffle plantations located in the foothills of the Spanish Pyrenees. We found that replacing one-half of the water deficit of the driest month ( moderate irrigation) promoted the proliferation of T. melanosporum mycorrhizae, while high irrigation reduced fine root production and truffle mycorrhizae. Glyphosate weed control improved seedling survival by up to 16% over control seedlings without jeopardizing truffle mycorrhizae in the first year. Fertilization did not improve seedling growth or influence its mycorrhizal status. We describe the persistent relationship between this ectomycorrhizal fungus and Q. ilex by quantifying old and new mycorrhizae and we discuss the ecological implications of the symbiosis.	Fischer, C.

'Ecosystem Research in the Agricultural Landscape/FAM, Munich' in southern Germany and 'Ecosystem Research in the Bornhoved Lake district' from northern Germany using ratios between microbial biomass content (Cmic), microbial metabolic quotient (qCO2) and organic carbon content (Corg). In the agricultural soils in southern Germany, the qCO2/Corg ratio differed significantly with respect to agricultural management in contrast to ecophysiological Cmic/Corg ratio. In addition, Cmic/Corg ratio decreased from 39 to 21 mg Cmic g-1 Corg and qCO2/Corg ratio increased from 72 to 180 mg CO2-C g-1 Cmic h-1 (g Corg g-1 soil)-1 with increasing soil depth. For the upper soil horizons from the landscape in northern Germany the two quotients differed significantly with reference to land use showing highest microbial colonization under grassland and lowest under beech forest. In contrast, C use efficiency was lowest in arable field under maize monoculture and highest in a wet grassland having a high organic C content.

J		Article		Effects of farming system, field margins and bait insect on the occurrence of insect pathogenic fungi in soils		Klingen, Ingeborg; Eilenberg, Jorgen; Meadow, Richard									Agriculture Ecosystems and Environment		2002	September, 2002	91	1-3	191-198	191	198	English	print					A method for baiting soil samples with Delia floralis larvae was developed, and a systematic survey was conducted on soils from northern Norway for insect pathogenic fungi, using D. floralis and Galleria mellonella larvae as bait. The occurrence of insect pathogenic fungi in soils from arable fields and adjacent field margins of conventionally and organically managed farms was compared. The study showed a significantly higher occurrence of insect pathogenic fungi in soils from arable fields of organically managed farms. No significant differences in the occurrence of insect pathogenic fungi were, however, found between the field margins of the two cropping systems. Fungal species identified in the study were Beauveria bassiana, Fusarium merismoides, Metarhizium anisopliae and Tolypocladium cylindrosporum. T. cylindrosporum was found more frequently when using D. floralis as the bait insect than when using G. mellonella.

Helgolaender Meeresuntersuchungen		1998	May 3, 1998-1999	52	3-4	259-275	259	275	English	print					The recent introduction of the macroalga Undaria pinnatifida (Harvey) Suringar into the North Atlantic is the latest of a large number of introductions, which have occurred over many years. Some have been deliberate introductions for mariculture or research, while most have been accidental, via vectors such as shipping and shellfish imports. Not all newly recorded species are introductions; some are thought to be merely extensions of distribution, e.g. Laminaria ochroleuca, while others may have been overlooked previously, e.g. Scytosiphon dotyi. Subsequent to its accidental introduction into the waters around the Mediterranean French coast at Sete, most likely with imported oysters, Undaria was deliberately introduced into the North Atlantic, to Brittany, in 1983 by IFREMER for commercial exploitation. Undaria has since spread from the original sites in Brittany, and is now established at several sites on the south coast of England. This paper discusses the introduced brown algae in the North Atlantic and outlines the establishment of Undaria in the UK.	Fletcher, R.

J		Article		Biomass energy in organic farming - the potential role of short rotation coppice		Jorgensen, Uffe (uffe.jorgensen@agrsci.dk) ; Dalgaard, Tommy; Kristensen, Erik Steen									Biomass and Bioenergy		2005		28	2	237-248	237	248	English	print					One of the aims of organic farming is to "reduce the use of non-renewable resources (e.g. fossil fuels) to a minimum." So far, however, only very little progress has been made to introduce renewable energy in organic farming. This paper presents energy balances of Danish organic farming compared with energy balances of conventional farming. In general, the conversion to organic farming leads to a lower energy use (approximately 10% per unit of product). But the production of energy in organic farming is very low compared with the extensive utilisation of straw from conventional farming in Denmark (energy content of straw used for energy production was equivalent to 18% of total energy input in Danish agriculture in 1996). Biomass is a key energy carrier with a good potential for on-farm development. Apart from utilising farm manure and crop residues for biogas production, the production of nutrient efficient short rotation coppice (SRC) is an option in organic farming. Alder (Abuts spp.) is an interesting crop due to its symbiosis with the actinomycete Frankia. which has the ability to fix up to 185 kg/ha nitrogen (N2) from the air. Yields obtained at different European sites are presented and the R&D needed to implement energy cropping in organic farming is discussed. Possible win-win solutions for SRC production in organic farming that may facilitate its implementation are: the protection of ground water quality in intensively farmed areas, utilisation of wastewater for irrigation, or combination with outdoor animal husbandry such as pigs or poultry.

The wheat quality and consumer safety is threatened by Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) caused by i.e. Fusarium culmorum, F. graminearum and F. avenaceum. Most of the wheat varieties grown in the EU today are susceptible to this disease. Crop management and chemical measures to prevent the disease and associated mycotoxin contamination are either not available or not feasible. The development of resistant varieties is the most reliable and environmentally sound means to combat this diseaseIn the presented paper, firstly an overview about initiatives on European, national and regional levels to tackle the disease are described involving a wide range of expertise from public and private research institutions as well as breeding and food processing companiesIn the second part and in more details, the results about two European-wide projects are presented1. From the EU-funded project "FUCOMYR" where research institutes and breeding companies from 6 European countries are cooperating together, results about the efficiency of conventional selection for resistant lines, artificial infection in mist irrigated fields and under controlled condition are demonstrated. This enabled the team of participants to detect 3 new DNA markers for Type 11 resistance by QTL mapping of segregating populations. Three genomic regions were found to be significantly associated with FHB resistance: the most-prominent effect was detected on the short arm of chromosome 3B, explaining up to 60% of the phenotypic variance for type 11 resistance. A further QTL was located on chromosome 5A and a third one on I B. The QTL regions on 3B and 5A were tagged with flanking SSR markers, the I B QTL was found associated with the high-molecular-weight glutenin locus. These results indicate that FHB resistance is under control of a few major QTL's operating together with an unknown number of minor genes2. In the EU-Concerted Action "MYCOTOCHAIN", partners from breeding research institutions, breeding companies, milling industries and food processors from five European countries were aiming to synchronise their activities and efforts towards mycotoxin control in cereal and cereal products for food and feed. The results of the proposed recommendations for mycotoxin contamination thresholds for the whole production chain from wheat breeding strategies until the final consumer products for European and possibly worldwide acceptance are demonstrated and discussed.

J		Article		Determination of microbial versus root-produced CO2 in an agricultural ecosystem by means of delta13CO2 measurements in soil air		Schuessler, Wolfram; Neubert, Rolf; Levin, Ingeborg; Fischer, Natalie; Sonntag, Christian									Tellus Series B Chemical and Physical Meteorology		2000	July, 2000	52B	3	909-918	909	918	English	print					The amounts of microbial and root-respired CO2 in a maize/winter wheat agricultural system in south western Germany were investigated by measurements of the CO2 mixing ratio and the 13C/12C ratio in soil air. CO2 fluxes at the soil surface for the period of investigation (1993-1995) were also determined. Root respired CO2 shows a strong correlation with the plant mass above ground surface of the respective vegetation (R2 gtoreq 0.88); the maximum CO2 release from roots was in August for the maize (2.0+-0.5 mmol m-2 h-1) and in June for winter wheat (1.5+-0.5 mmol m-2 h-1). Maximum CO2 production by roots correlate well with the maximum amount of plant root matter. Integrating the CO2 production over the whole growing season and normalizing to the dry root matter yields, the CO2 production per gram dry organic root matter (DORM) of maize was found to be 0.14+-0.03 gC (g DORM)-1. At the sites investigated, root-produced CO2 contributed (16+-4)% for maize, and (24+-4)% for winter wheat, respectively, to the total annual CO2 production in the soil (450+-50 gC m-2 for maize, 210+-30 gC m-2 for winter wheat).

J		Article		Assessment of populations of Gracilaria chilensis (Gracilariales, Rhodophyta) utilizing RAPDs		Meneses, Isabel									Journal of Applied Phycology		1996		8	3	185-192	185	192	English						Phenotypic variability and mixing of material due to massive cultivation for commercial purposes has contributed to the taxonomic confusion of Gracilaria in Chile. At least four species with cylindrical thalli and similar morphology have been recorded. However, since establishment of G. chilensis, most of the collected thalli have been attributed to this species despite the lack of diagnostic features. In an attempt to resolve whether Gracilaria from 3 localities where it grows in natural and artificial populations belongs to the same species, gametophytic samples were compared by applying RAPD-PCR to their total DNA. This was analysed using 25 different 10-mer primers from which 21 revealed polymorphism within and between populations. Similarity matrices and cluster analyses were performed based on the presence/absence of bands representing fragments of DNA generated by random amplification. Similarity values between two of the populations were equivalent to those detected within a third, indicating the mixing of genetic material due to transplant between the two former localities. Similarities between samples of Chilean Gracilaria and G. tenuistipitata from Sweden are considerably lower (0.45-0.53) than those between populations from Chile (0.74-0.88), confirming the existence of a single specific taxon, G. chilensis, in these three localities.

J		Article		Inoculum sources and genotypic diversity of Phytophthora infestans in Southern Flevoland, the Netherlands		Zwankhuizen, M. J.; Govers, F.; Zadoks, J. C.									European Journal of Plant Pathology		2000	September, 2000	106	7	667-680	667	680	English	print					Genotypic changes in populations of Phytophthora infestans in Southern Flevoland (150 km2) were analysed by characterising isolates from potato refuse piles, conventional and organic potato fields, and potatoes and tomatoes in allotment gardens for mating type (1712 isolates) and DNA fingerprint pattern using probe RG57 (1048 isolates). The overall percentages of genotypes (and of isolates) that were A2 varied from 32 (4) in 1994 to 45 (56) in 1996. Among the 1048 isolates 170 different genotypes were identified, of which 138 (81%) were 'rare' (i.e., detected in only one sampling site in the research area during 1993-1996). Many rare genotypes were encountered in organic potato fields and in allotment gardens. In 1994 and 1995, four genotypes were abundant. The highest percentages of isolates with these 'common' genotypes were encountered in refuse piles and conventional potato fields. The common genotypes were nearly absent in 1996, suggesting that the population may have passed through a bottleneck at the transition from 1995 to 1996. The Shannon index of genotypic diversity was high in allotment gardens and in organic potato fields. For the total populations the normalised Shannon index of genotypic diversity increased from 0.34 in 1994, with weather favourable to late blight, to 0.61 in 1996, with unfavourable weather. The high numbers of rare genotypes detected every year indicate that oospores may act as an infection source in commercial potato fields. However, refuse piles were identified as the most important infection sources for commercial fields in 1994 and 1995. In 1996 disease in commercial organic fields was probably initiated by a few genotypes originating from seed tubers. In allotment gardens oospores were probably the most important infection source.

In such a gradient system, the fluxes of methane and oxygen are controlled by diffusion and consumption rates, and the rate-limiting substrate is maintained at a minimum concentration at the layer of consumption. Opposing gradients of methane and oxygen were mimicked in a specific cultivation set-up in which growth of methanotrophic bacteria occurred as a sharp band at either c. 5 or 20 mm below the air-exposed end. Two new strains of methanotrophic bacteria were isolated with this system. One isolate, strain LC 1, belonged to the Methylomonas genus (type I methantroph) and contained soluble methane mono-oxygenase. Another isolate, strain LC 2, was related to the Methylobacter group (type I methantroph), as determined by 16S rRNA gene and pmoA sequence similarities. However, the partial pmoA sequence was only 86% related to cultured Methylobacter species. This strain accumulated significant amounts of formaldehyde in conventional cultivation with methane and oxygen, which may explain why it is preferentially enriched in a gradient cultivation system.

J		Article		Contents of free amino acids and biogenic amines in Hungarian musts from organically grown grapes.	Gehalt an freien aminosauren und biogenen aminen in Ungarischen mosten aus biologischer traubenproduktion	Sardy, Diana Nyitrai (Diana.Sardy@uni-corvinus.hu) ; Kallay, Miklos									Mitteilungen Klosterneuburg		2005		55	3-4	94-100	94	100	German						In Hungary organic products as well as organic wines are getting more and more popular. In organic viticulture the nitrogen application, which can influence the contents of nitrogenous compounds in must and wine, is completely different from that in conventional viticulture. Free amino acids are a good source of nutrients for yeasts. Biogenic amines are found in many foodstuffs and semiluxury foods. They develop from amino acids through decarboxylation of lactic acid bacteria. When amino acids are present in wine, this is an indicator for insufficient hygienic conditions during the winemaking process. In this investigation free amino acids and biogenic acids were determined in Hungarian organic Musts. Our results correspond to those found in literature. The amino acids proline and arginine were detected in highest concentrations. With respect to biogenic amines it was found that the must contained ethylamine and methylamine in higher concentrations. Histamine was only detected in two samples. Additional investigations into biogenic amines in organic wines should be carried out.

J		Article	Literature Review	[Quality of organic animal products.]	Qualite des produits biologiques d'origine animale	Kouba, M.									Productions Animales (Paris)		2002	Juillet, 2002	15	3	161-169	161	169	French	print					'Organic' is a labelling term that denotes products that have been produced in accordance with organic standards. There is a community regulation on organic livestock production (council regulation ndegree 1804/1999) that is applied in France (24/08/2000, CC REPAB F). There is a high demand for organic products in industrialised countries. It is therefore important to carefully consider the nutritional and sensory qualities and the safety of organic foods in order to identify problems and issues that require attention. The production of organic food of animal origin is done in many ways and uses many breeds. Therefore, a real comparison with conventionally produced food is difficult and there is a limited amount of published data. No clear trends have been established in terms of nutritional and organoleptic quality differences between organic and conventional foods. Organically produced food has lower levels of veterinary drugs and pesticides. The 'organic' label provides also assurance to consumers that no food ingredient has been subject to irradiation and that genetically modified organisms have been excluded. However, it seems that organic farming could lead to a higher risk for the contamination of products by microbes present in animals and in manure. In summary, in some cases, organic food gets better marks, in others, conventionally produced food scores higher.

J		Article		Nitrous oxide emissions and denitrification N-losses from agricultural soils in the Bornhoeved Lake region: Influence of organic fertilizers and land-use		Mogge, Bernhard; Kaiser, Ernst-August; Munch, Jean-Charles									Soil Biology and Biochemistry		1999	Aug., 1999	31	9	1245-1252	1245	1252	English	print					In situ denitrification N-losses and nitrous oxide emissions were measured over 12 months from sandy soils in Northern Germany. We compared a field in a crop rotation, fertilized mainly with farmyard manure for 30 y (field-FM; N-input: 93 kg N ha-1 y-1), with a field under maize monoculture, fertilized with cattle slurry for 30 y (field-CS; N-input: 333 kg N ha-1 y-1). A grassland was also investigated for comparison (N-input: 92 kg N ha-1 y-1). Annual gaseous N-losses from field-FM were twice those from the other sites (denitrification: 4.9 kg N2O-N ha-1 y-1; nitrous oxide: 5.3 kg N2O-N ha-1 y-1). This reflected the higher microbial biomass content and approximately neutral pH at field-FM. The smaller N-emissions from the grassland were attributed to its relatively dry siting on a slope of 20%. The ratio of denitrification N-loss-to-nitrous oxide emission revealed nitrification as the major nitrous oxide producing process at all sites. Predictors of the temporalchanges in N-emissions were nitrate (field-FM), pH (field-CS) and temperature (grassland), indicating the heterogeneity of management.

J		Article		Chemical and microbiological soil characteristics controlling glyphosate mineralisation in Danish surface soils		Gimsing, Anne Louise (angi@kvl.dk) ; Borggaard, Ole Kragholm; Jacobsen, Ole Stig; Aamand, Jens; Sorensen, Jan									Applied Soil Ecology		2004	November 2004	27	3	233-242	233	242	English	print					Adsorption and mineralisation of the herbicide glyphosate in five contrasting Danish surface soils were investigated using 14C labelled glyphosate. A comparison was made to several chemical and microbiological soil characteristics to identify their role in regulating the fate of glyphosate in these soils. Glyphosate was rapidly adsorbed to iron and aluminium oxides, but were later released from these pools during mineralisation. In soils with high mineralisation rates the metabolite AMPA was formed and adsorbed. Of all the soil factors tested, the rate of mineralisation was best correlated with the population size of Pseudomonas spp. bacteria in the soils. Phosphate addition had a stimulating effect on glyphosate degradation in soils with low mineralisation rates, but no effect or a negative effect on mineralisation in soils with high mineralisation rates. Finally, mineralisation rates were higher in soils from organically managed soils than in soils from conventional fanning. The results indicate that the activity of glyphosate mineralising bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas spp.) was a major factor controlling the fate of glyphosate in the soils. Copyright 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J		Article		Soil quality aspects of humid sandy loams as influenced by organic and conventional long-term management		Schjonning, Per; Elmholt, Susanne; Munkholm, Lars J.; Debosz, Kasia									Agriculture Ecosystems and Environment		2002	March, 2002	88	3	195-214	195	214	English	print					The development of low-input farming systems requires knowledge of the extent to which management characteristics influence the soil as a habitat for micro-organisms and a medium for plant growth. This paper presents a study of long-term effects of organically and conventionally cultivated systems on a range of soil physical, chemical and biological characteristics in Denmark. Seven soils were included, falling into three groups (I-III). Each group consists of an organically managed soil (Org) referenced by one or two conventionally managed soils (Conv) with the same soil type (sandy loam) and pedological history. All organically managed soils were dairy farm soils (H), which had been organically managed for 46, 47 and 40 years, respectively. They had forage crop rotations and received animal manure. The conventional soils were either dairy farm soils or soils grown to annual cash crops (P). Undisturbed core samples were used for assessing dry bulk density and water retention. Undisturbed cubic samples were used for assessing wet stability of macro-aggregates, clay dispersibility, microbial biomass C, beta-glucosidase activity, ergosterol, and the abundance of different groups of fungi. Penetration resistance and ease of soil fragmentation were measured in the field. The quantifying methods were supplemented by a visual inspection of soil structure of the top 30 cm soil in the field. Irrespective of agricultural system, the use of tractors and heavy machinery had caused compaction of the subsoil in the form of a dense pan below ploughing depth. In group I, the H-soils were heavily trafficked and this overshadowed the long-term effects of the diversified crop rotations and animal manure applications on the physical parameters. Generally, the results highlight the paramount influence of soil tillage and traffic in agriculture. Further, the results confirm the positive effects of organic manures and diversified crop rotations on soil quality aspects. Microbial biomass C was found to be higher in organically than in conventionally managed dairy farm soils, and appeared to correlate linearly to the volume of 0.2-3.0 mum pores ('protective' pore space). The simple model did, however, not explain a lower microbial biomass for two soils dressed only with synthetic fertilisers. The results further indicated that the contribution of the different biotic mechanisms responsible for macro-aggregation varied from soil to soil. The results revealed promising correlations between quantitative scientific laboratory methods and descriptive methods in the field.

J		Article		Effects of different cultivation systems (soil management, nitrogen fertilization) on the epidemics of fungal diseases in oilseed rape (Brassica napus L. var. napus)		SOCHTING, H. P.; Verreet, J. -A. (javerreet@phytomed.uni-kiel.de)									Zeitschrift fuer Pflanzenkrankheiten und Pflanzenschutz		2004	January 2004	111	1	1-29	1	29	English	print					The effects of different Cultivation systems on disease incidence and severity in oilseed rape were investigated on two sites in Schleswig-Holstein in the period 1997-1999. The cultivars 'Joker' (Futterkamp site) and 'Falcon' (Hohenschulen site) were grown either by conventional methods (plough/drill), by methods with reduced tillage such as drilling following timed cultivation (cultivator/drill combination) or sowing underneath the soil by a rotary-cultivator (rotavator/drill combination). The cultivation systems differed further in the amount of mineral N fertilizer application (0, 120, 240 kg/ha). The disease incidence (DI) and severity (DS) of oilseed rape pathogens (Phoma lingam, Verticillium dahliae, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Pseudocercosporella capsellae, Botrytis cinerea, Alternaria brassicae, Peronospora parasitica) were assessed in untreated control plots. Despite varietal differences, pathogen reaction to different cultivation systems on both sites was largely similar. During the 3-year investigation period, P. lingam, the causal organism of root collar and stem rot (black leg), dominated. As a rule, the disease was present from the earliest plant growth stages through harvest whereby first symptoms of black leg could be determined from flowering growth stage onwards. The typical S. sclerotiorum infection of the rape stem remained very low in all trial years with a maximum of 8% DI and a DS of 0.3. Notably late Sclerotinia infections of the upper lateral branches and pods Occurred at Futterkamp in 1998 and 1999 and in 1998 at Hohenschulen with a DI of up to 50%. The causal organism V dahliae was determined on all sites and in all trial years up to harvest. The most important leaf disease pathogen was P. parasitica. More severe infections of P. capsellae appeared on leaves in 1998 at the Hohenschulen site only. B. cinerea and A. brassicae were present throughout the year at low infection levels. The soil management systems plough/drill and cultivator/drill or a rotavator/drill combination did not affect the main foliage pathogens (P. lingam, P. parasitica). The DI of vascular pathogen V. dahliae was reduced with plough/drill compared to cultivator or rotavator/drill systems. Black leg infection by P. lingam was not affected by the cultivation system. Increased N fertilizer application resulted in increasing infection by P. parasitica. There also was a trend towards increased DS of V dahliae, although results were not always significant. On the other hand, foliage and root collar infection by P. lingam was not affected by N fertilizer application rates. Compared to the results of increased N applications, decreased applications resulted in increased infection by S. sclerotiorum on upper side branches and pods at later growth stages (GS 92). Harvest yields rose with increased N fertilization, and there was a trend towards increased yield through inversion cultivation (plough/drill). Very high oil contents were achieved in all three trial years with these yields correlating negatively with N fertilizer applications.

In the years 2002, 2003 and 2004 fruit analyses and storage experiments were carried out with apples produced under organic and integrated conditions with the same tree row management methods. Fruit compactness varied depending on variety and year, contents Of soluble dry substance and fruit acids depending on variety, year and fruiting density. A direct impact of plant protection strategies on these parameters was not found. In storage experiments organically produced apples of the varieties 'Pinova' and 'Topaz' proved to be very susceptible towards Gloeosporium. Repeated treatments with sulphur and copper (3 kg and 0.2 kg per ha, resp.), CA storage and hot water treatment resulted in a reduction of Gloeosporium infection.

Veterinary Research (Paris)		1994		25	2-3	218-222	218	222	French						The relationships between nutrition and udder inflammation/infection were studied in the dairy cow using an ecopathological approach. The study ('enquete ecopathologique Bretagne) was performed over 4 yr in French herds with high-lactating cows. A long distribution time of Italian ryegrass silage and a low quantity of dietary cereal-based concentrates in the first 2 months of lactation was linked with low milk leukocyte counts, probably due to a high dietary energetic level or to a polyunsaturated fatty acid imbalance and a subsequent decrease in the synthesis of leukotriene LTB4. In the late gestation period, a long distribution time of fresh English rye-grass, which induced high uraemia and a larger distribution of vitamins A, D and E, was related to lower frequencies of major pathogens in the milk.

J		Article		Lectin histochemical studies on Sphaerospora sp. (Myxosporea) from Italian brown trout, Salmo trutta L		De Mateo, M. Marin; Bovo, G.; Comuzzi, M.; Adams, A.									Journal of Fish Diseases		1997		20	1	51-58	51	58	English						A Sphaerospora sp. (Myxosporea) infection (presumably S. truttae) was identified on a trout farm in northeastern Italy. Parasites were detected in kidneys from infected brown trout, Salmo trutta L., over a 2-year period. Extrasporogonic, sporogonic stages and mature spores were simultaneously detected in the same fish. Traditional diagnostic methods for Sphaerospora spp. rely on the detection of the myxosporean developmental stages in Giemsa-stained kidney smears or haematoxylin-eosin stained tissue sections. A histochemical method was employed where 10 biotinylated lectins (Con-A, DBA, SBA, GS-1, PHAP, LEA, PWM, RCA-1, WGA and UEA-I) and the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) were used on Sphaerospora-infected brown trout renal tissues and kidney imprints. Five monoclonal antibodies against PKX (Mab12, MabA3, MabC5, MabD4 and MabB4) were also tested. A lectin glycoconjugate binding pattern for Sphaerospora spp. is presented. This staining method shows that SBA lectin (Glycine max agglutinin) is a useful tool for the detection of the Sphaerospora spp. Only MabB4 bound some of the most mature sporogonic stages. In contrast Mabs12, A3, C5 and D4, and GS-I lectin (Griffonia simplicifolia agglutinin) did not stain any of the Sphaerospora spp. stages, but did bind very specifically to the sporogonic and extrasporogonic stages of PKX, the causative agent of proliferative kidney disease (PKD).

J	15488626	Article		Detection and relative quantitation of Soil-borne cereal mosaic virus (SBCMV) and Polymyxa graminis in winter wheat using real-time PCR (TaqMan(R))		Ratti, Claudio; Budge, Giles (g.budge@csl.gov.uk) ; Ward, Lisa; Clover, Gerard; Rubies-Autonell, Concepcion; Henry, Christine									Journal of Virological Methods		2004	December 1, 2004	122	1	95-103	95	103	English	print					Soil-borne cereal mosaic virus (SBCMV) was first reported affecting wheat crops in Italy in 1960 and has spread subsequently to many other European countries, including the UK. SBCMV causes a serious disease of wheat, reducing yield by up to 70%; growing resistant varieties represents the only economical means of control. Real-time RT-PCR and PCR assays based on TaqMan(R) chemistry were developed for the detection and quantitation of SBCMV and its vector, Polymyxa graminis. Each assay incorporated an RNA or DNA specific internal control to facilitate quantitation. Nucleic acid extracts from SBCMV-infected plants were diluted in a nucleic acid extract from a healthy plant and amplified by real-time PCR to produce a standard curve. The standard curve was used to quantify the amount of SBCMV and P. graminis in plant samples. The sensitivity of the real-time assays were compared to established serological quantitation and conventional PCR methods by testing a range of SBCMV-infected wheat varieties. The results indicate that real-time assays were a 1000 times more sensitive than ELISA for the quantitation of SBCMV, and a 100 times more sensitive than conventional PCR for the quantitation of P. graminis. Real-time assays enabled sensitive, reproducible and specific detection of both virus and vector in wheat tissues. The real-time assays are potentially useful tools for determining variations in virus and vector concentrations in plant tissue from wheat varieties differing in resistance to SBCMV.

Models presented in manuals should be used only for guidance, and local experience from pilot and full-scale plants of a particular pond type is extremely valuable. Anaerobic WSP are single-stage, continuous-flow, anaerobic reactors operating at ambient temperatures and low volumetric organic loading as a pretreatment method. This article presents a literature review on the different available operational parameters of anaerobic ponds and examples from full-scale plant performance worldwide. On a wastewater management scheme, involving reuse for agriculture, the zero-energy demand of a waste stabilization pond series for the effective removal of organic and microbiological loading under existing legislation and guidelines will remain a valuable tool for sustainable development.

J		Article		A qualitative multi-attribute model for assessing the impact of cropping systems on soil quality		Bohanec, Marko (marko.bohanec@ijs.si) ; Cortet, Jerome; Griffiths, Bryan; Znidarsic, Martin; Debeljak, Marko; Caul, Sandra; Thompson, Jacqueline; Krogh, Paul H.									Pedobiologia		2007		51	3	239-250	239	250	English						An important goal of the European Commission-funded ECOGEN project is to developa computer-based decision support system (DSS) for the assessment of economic and ecological impacts of using genetically modified crops. In ecological impact assessment, special emphasis is put on soil biology and estimating soil quality from the observed biological. parameters. Methodologically, we have addressed this goat using model-based DSS, taking the approach of quatitative multi-attribute model-ling. The approach is based on developing various hierarchical multi-attribute models that consist of qualitative attributes and ulitity (aggregation) functions, represented by decision rules. The model presented in this paper assesses the impact of cropping systems on soil quality and can subsequently be used to assess crop management options. It was developed as a collaboration between ECOGEN soil experts and decision analysts, and consists of 34 attributes, hierarchically structured into eight levels. There are 21 input attributes, most of which measure the richness and biomass of representative soil organisms. The assessment of soil quality is based on two main indicators: (1) soil diversity (assessed through microfauna, mesofauna and macrofauna richness) and (2) soil. functioning (in terms of leaching, comminution, mineratisation and plant growth). In the paper, we address the methodological aspects of the model and its development, and describe the components of the model (attributes, value scates, decision rules and weights). We present initial results of its application to the assessment of crop management on soil quality in the case of using conventional and Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)-maize at three field sites in France and Denmark. Our finding was that soil quality was unaffected even though several input attributes had changed. We also analyse the sensitivity of the model and discuss its current and potential contribution to soil quality management.

Rhodococci were halotolerant microorganisms growing in a media containing up to 15% NaCl. All the strains oxidized n-alkanes of crude oil. An influence of the cultivation temperatures (28 or 45 degrees C) and organic supplements on the degradation of C-12-C-30 n-alkanes in oxidized oil by two bacterial strains of the genus Pseudomonas was shown. The introduction of acetate, propionate, butyrate, ethanol, and sucrose led mainly to decreased oxidation of petroleum paraffins. At certain cultivation temperatures, the addition of volatile fatty acid salts increased the content of certain n-alkanes in oxidized oil as compared to crude oil.	Borzenkov, I.

Effective control of its spread requires that sources of infection and routes of transmission be disclosed as quickly as possible. At present such investigations are still performed by conventional epidemiological methods. In the recent past, however, molecular typing systems were added to the spectrum of epidemiological tools. Unfortunately, they were applied to retrospective investigations rather than used as an aid in the health care system. In this study, 515 Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated during 1997 and 1998 in Vienna were analysed by spoligotyping, a molecular technique requiring no further cultivation of mycobacteria. The study was aimed to assess the suitability of the method as a quick means of disclosing new cases. Thus, clusters obtained by spoligotyping were analysed along with demographic and epidemiological data and compared with clusters obtained by conventional epidemiological techniques alone. In addition, spoligotype-forming clusters were matched with an international database containing spoligotypes from four different studies. Of 515 isolates, 107 showed an unique pattern. The remaining 408 isolates were distributed into two large clusters of 82 and 73 isolates and into 49 smaller ones consisting of 2 to 33 isolates each. The two spoligotypes forming the large clusters were identical with the most prevalent spoligotypes in the world. Therefore, for the tuberculosis authorities, information was only gained by excluding rather than tracing possible ways of transmission. Twenty-two of the 49 spoligotypes forming smaller clusters were identical with strains found in other parts of the world. Seventeen of 22 infection chains assumed by conventional investigations were confirmed by spoligotyping. In small clusters, an additional 24 infections were assumed due to similarities such as living conditions or socioeconomic status. In 27 clusters, all patients sharing the same strain belong to the same country or geographical area. In conclusion, spoligotyping proved suitable as an early guide in conventional investigations to trace routes of M. tuberculosis transmission in a community. However, when a strain isolated from a patient belongs to a spoligotype shared by many isolates, a second molecular typing method is required.

Microbial characteristics and emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide of arable and grassland soils		Dilly, Oliver; Mogge, Bernhard; Kutsch, Werner L.; Kappen, Ludger; Munch, Jean-Charles									Biogeochemistry (Dordrecht)		1997		39	2	189-205	189	205	English						Soil microbial biomass content, organic carbon mineralization as well as arginine ammonification rates were estimated in samples from arable and grassland soils and carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emission rates were measured in situ at four sites along a catena. Soil microbial biomass content increased in the order, maize monoculture lt crop rotation lt dry grassland lt wet grassland. The two arable soils had similar rates of carbon mineralization in the laboratory at 22 degree C (basal respiration) as well as in situ (carbon dioxide emission) at field temperature. Under crop rotation, maize monoculture and dry grassland, the arginine ammonification rate significantly correlated to the microbial biomass content. In contrast, the biomass-specific ammonification rate was low in wet grassland soil, as were in situ N-2O emission rates. Data from all sites together revealed no general relationship between microbial biomass content and C and N mineralization rates. In addition, there was no general relationship between the quantity of soil microbial biomass and the emission rates of the greenhouse gases CO-2 and N-2O. The maize monoculture induced a soil microbial community that was less efficient in using organic carbon compounds, as shown by the high metabolic quotient (respiration rate per unit of biomass). However, microbial biomass content was proportional to basal respiration rate in soils under crop rotation, dry and wet grassland. Arginine ammonification rate was related to microbial biomass content only in fertilized soils. Applications of high quantities of inorganic nitrogen and farmyard manure apparently increase in situ N-2O emission rates, particularly under crop rotation. The microbial biomass in the unfertilized wet grassland soil seems to be a sink for nitrogen.	Mogge, Bernhard; GSF, Forschungszent. Umwelt Gesundheit GmbH, Inst. Bodenoekol.

European Journal of Plant Pathology		2002	September 2002	108	7	667-673	667	673	English	print					Details of our long-term research programme concerning the epidemiology of Fusarium spp. and mycotoxin production are summarized. Evaluation of the occurrence of Fusarium spp., mainly on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum), was carried out by investigating Fusarium infection and mycotoxin contamination. Two to 15% of grains were infested during 1995-1998 at three climatologically differing localities of the Rhineland, Germany. Disease progress was accelerated by rainfall during the flowering season. The species most frequently isolated were Fusarium avenaceum, F. poae, F. culmorum and F. graminearum. The mean deoxynivalenol (DON) content varied from 19 mug kg-1 (1995) to 310 mug kg-1 (1998) and was not always correlated with disease severity. Organic farming systems showed lower rates of infection with ear blight and lower mycotoxin contamination than conventional farming systems.

From World War 11 to 1971, populations of these species increased as rice cultivation expanded in the region in a political context that supported agriculture. They then fell, likely because of decreased cultivation and increased pesticide use to control a rice pest. The species increased again after 2000 with the advent of more targeted pest-management strategies, mainly the results of European regulations decisions. An intertwined influence of political context, environmental constraints, technical improvements, and social factors led to changes in mosquito abundance that had potential consequences on malaria and WNV transmission. These findings suggest that anthropogenic changes should not be underestimated in vectorborne disease recrudescence.

Folia Microbiologica		1992		37	1	60-65	60	65	English						The possibility of cultivation of fungi on sugar cane waste (leaves and stalk tops) was tested. Having been crushed, macerated and heated, this material becomes a suitable substrate for cultivation of oyster mushrooms. Selected hybrids of Pleurotus ostreatus times ostreatus form Florida rapidly colonized the substrate and, in the first phase, yielded more than 10% of fresh fruiting bodies per initial mass of the wet substrate, which is considered to be the efficiency limit of this technology. The growth cycle in Cuba is shorter than in Europe. Under the tested temperature and light conditions in Cuba, all strains formed white fruiting bodies, as compared to a multicolored variety developed in Czechoslovakia. Some of the newly obtained hybrids were found to have better properties than the original production strains. Hybrids of Cuban origin should be prepared. Besides common, well-known pests, several species of ants damage the cultures of oyster mushrooms.	Ginterova, A.; Hrabovcova, J.; Feedstuffs Res.

In order to assess the autogenic restoration of ex-melon fields, three fields, all adjacent to a patch of steppe, were studied On each field, vegetation, seed bank, seed rain, seed dispersal by ants and some habitat variables were sampled along three transects perpendicular to field boundaries. Our results show that, 20 years after the abandonment of cultivation, only a few steppe species had colonised the first three meters of field margins. The autogenic restoration of ex-melon fields is thus extremely slow. We discuss possibilities for ecological restoration by sowing or transplanting keystone species in order to identify the factors responsible for this limited autogenic restoration.

J		Article	Literature Review	PAST AND PROSPECTS OF FORAGE MAIZE BREEDING IN EUROPE. I. THE GRASS CELL WALL AS A BASIS OF GENETIC VARIATION AND FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS IN FEEDING VALUE		Barriere, Y. (yves.barriere@lusignan.inra.fr) ; Alber, D.; Dolstra, O.; Lapierre, C.; Motto, M.; Ordas, A.; Van Waes, J.; Vlasminkel, L.; Welcker, C.; Monod, J. P.									Maydica		2005		50	3-4	259-274	259	274	English						Although maize was early recognized as an excellent forage plant soon after its introduction in Europe, during a long time it was only bred for grain traits. Conversely to agronomic value, a steady decline in the average cell wall digestibility of hybrids was observed since the 1950s, despite a greater specialization of hybrids between forage and grain uses, except for the Netherlands where varietal registration has taken into account traits related to plant digestibility for longer times. Modern hybrids had on average a 5.5% lower in vivo cell wall digestibility than the old ones, leading to an organic matter digestibility reduction by 2%, despite a tendency to a Slight, but significant, increase in grain content. When compared to the well-known early hybrid LG11, hybrids with a lower cell wall digestibility were 32, 63, 75, 84, and 93% in each of the registration periods before 1981, 1989: 1994 1999, and in or after 1999, respectively. Alleles for highly friable and digestible cell walls were either eliminated during breeding for stalk standability and breakage resistance, or lost by genetic drift during breeding for grain yield. Breeding of highly digestible and ingestible forage maize may depend on the reevaluation and use of old genetic resources that are not Currently used, and/or specific breeding of digestibility/ingestibility resource lines. Cell Wall Structure and organization, and lignified tissue patterning, are the key factor explaining silage maize variation both for cell wall digestibility and intake. In maize, as in other Poaceae, p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid, along with its array of dehydrodimers, are ester and/or ether-linked to the cell wall polymers. Linkages of pCA esters to syringyl lignin units may markedly influence not only the binding mode of these lignin units, but also the spatial organization of the polymers and their interactions with polysaccharides. Similarly, ferulates cross-linking between guaiacyl residues and arabinoxylans is detrimental to cell wall digestibility, acting as a reinforcement of the wall structure, and decreasing wall component accessibility to microorganism enzymes. Moreover, diferulate cross-linking of arabinoxylan chains is also involved in cell wall digestibility decrease, and is commonly thought to play a role in stiffening cell walls. While first improvements of maize cell wall digestibility were (will still be) based on whole plant digestibility tests, understanding the biochemical and molecular basis of cell wall biogenesis, organization, and lignification, is now required to realize further progress in plant cell wall digestibility and intake.

Average urea turnover rates were 1.5 to 4.2 mug N g-1 d-1 indicating that the soil urea pool was turned over every 9 to 30 min. Urea turnover rates were generally lowest in set-aside soil with increasing activities in bulk and rhizosphere soil from a barley field. Gross N mineralization and urea turnover rates were correlated (r = 0.79, P < 0.005) and of similar size in the three soils. The high urea turnover rates indicated that urea-N was immobilized directly in soil microorganisms, rather than mineralized to the free NH4+ pool. Our study suggests that microbial urea turnover, by-passing the conventional mineralization-immobilization pathway involving a free NH4+ pool, has a significant role in N cycling of agricultural soils.

J		Article		Vineyard soils under organic and conventional management - microbial biomass and activity indices and their relation to soil chemical properties		Probst, Bjoern; Schueler, Christian; Joergensen, Rainer Georg (joerge@wiz.uni-kassel.de)									Biology and Fertility of Soils		2008	FEB 2008	44	3	443-450	443	450	English						Eight vineyards in Pfaffenheim (P) and Turckheim (T) close to Colmar, France, forming four pairs of organic and conventional vineyards, were analyzed for microbial biomass and activity indices in relation to important soil chemical properties (carbon, nutrient elements, heavy metals) and also to differences between the bottom and top positions on the vineyard slope. The question was whether the vineyard management affects especially the soil microbiological indices. Three locations were on limestone (P-I, P-II, T-II), one on granite (T-I). The gravel content (> 2 mm) ranged from 9 to 47%. The management systems had no significant main effect on the contents of organic C, total N, P, and S. The mean total contents of man-derived heavy metals decreased in the order Cu (164 mu g g(-1)) > Zn (100 mu g g(-1) soil) > Pb (32 mu g g(-1) soil). The contents of microbial biomass C varied between 320 and 1,000 mu g g(-1) soil. The significantly highest content was found at location P-II, the significantly lowest at the moderately acidic location T-I. The contents of microbial biomass N and adenosine triphosphate showed a similar trend. At location T-I, the fungal ergosterol-to-microbial biomass C ratio and the metabolic quotient qCO(2) were significantly highest, whereas the percentage of soil organic C present as microbial biomass C was lowest. Highest percentages of soil organic C present as microbial biomass C and lowest qCO(2) values were found in the organic in comparison with the conventional vineyards. None of the soil microbiological indices was significantly affected by the position on the slope, but all were significantly affected by the management system. This was mainly due to the highest index levels in the organic vineyard location P-II with the longest history in organic management.

S		Book Chapter		Malaria in Southern Europe: resurgence from the past?		Alten, Bulent (bulentalten@gmail.com) ; Kampen, Helge (helge.kampen@web.de) ; Fontenille, Didier (fontenil@mpl.ird.fr)			Takken, W; Knols, BGJ						Emerging Pests and Vector-Borne Diseases in Europe	Ecology and Control of Vector-Borne Diseases	2007		1		35-57	35	57	English						Malaria is an ancient diseasFe with historic records of high endemicity in southern Europe. With the exception of Turkey, the disease was eliminated from this region in the 20(th) Century by a mixture of targeted control, habitat modification and improvements in general living standards. Here we examine whether the disease might resurge in southern Europe under the environmental and climatic changes anticipated for the future. Populations of malaria vectors remain high in many countries of the continent, and their presence poses a risk of renewed transmission, should infected human hosts be available. The great plains of many southern European countries provide ideal habitats for malaria vectors. In the past 50 years, particularly in Italy, Greece and Turkey, the expansion of rice cultivation has resulted in great increases of the population densities of potential malaria vectors and current environmental conditions are suitable for malaria transmission. In addition, malaria remains endemic in the coastal and internal plains of the Asian parts of Turkey. This region also boarders on malaria-endemic countries such as Syria, Iran, Azerbaijan and Armenia. The increased agricultural activities and associated human migration in search of labour may serve to spread malaria across Europe and into currently malaria-free zones. This concerns mostly the upsurge of Plasmodium vivax, currently the only malaria parasite causing autochthonous cases in southern Europe. Increased international travel has caused an upsurge in cases of imported malaria in all European regions. However, the high level of health care and tendency of people to settle in urban areas, where malaria vector densities are low, are likely to prevent renewed outbreaks. Records of autochthonous transmission of (imported) malaria are rare and unlikely to cause renewed epidemics. It is concluded that under environmental and climate change the southern European region remains vulnerable to malaria transmission, and that locally outbreaks of malaria may occur, favoured by conditions that promote transmission of the disease. It remains to be seen whether the vector-parasite system is capable to adapt to the predicted changes and can adjust with evolutionary changes.

J	21959541	Article		Organic contaminants from sewage sludge applied to agricultural soils - False alarm regarding possible problems for food safety?		Laturnus, Frank (frank.laturnus@tema.liu.se) ; von Arnold, Karin; Gron, Christian									Environmental Science and Pollution Research International		2007	MAY 2007	14	1, Sp. Iss. SI	53-60	53	60	English						Goal, Scope and Background. Sewage sludge produced in wastewater treatment contains large amounts of organic matter and nutrients and could, therefore, be suitable as fertiliser. However, with the sludge, besides heavy metals and pathogenic bacteria, a variety of organic contaminants can be added to agricultural fields. Whether the organic contaminants from the sludge can have adverse effects on human health and wildlife if these compounds enter the food chain or groundwater still remains a point of controversial discussion.Main Features. This paper presents an overview on the present situation in Europe and a surnmary of some recent results on the possible uptake of organic contaminants by crops after addition to agricultural fields by sewage sludge.Results. Greenhouse experiments and field trials were performed to study the degradation and uptake of organic micro-contaminants in sludge-amended agricultural soil in crops, such as barley and carrots grown in agricultural soil amended with anaerobically-treated sewage sludge from a wastewater treatment plant, but studies hitherto have revealed no immediate risks. Common sludge contaminants such as linear alkylbenzene sulphonates (LAS), nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPE), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), bis(diethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), showed neither accumulation in soil nor uptake in plants.Discussion. It is assumed that the annual amount of sewage sludge produced in Europe will increase in the future, mainly due to larger amounts of high quality drinking water needed by an increasing population and due to increasing demands for cleaner sewage water. Application of sewage sludge to agricultural soils is sustainable and economical due to nutrient cycling and disposal of sewage sludge. However, this solution also involves risks with respect to the occurrence of organic contaminants and other potentially harmful contents such as pathogens and heavy metals present in the sludge. There have been concerns that organic contaminants may accumulate in the soil, be taken up by plants and thereby transferred to humans via the food chain. Results obtained so far revealed, however, no immediate risk of accumulation of common organic sludge contaminants in soil or uptake in plants when applying sewage sludge to agricultural soil. With very high dosages of sewage sludge, there may be a risk for accumulation of very apolar contaminants, such as DEHP, to the soil.Conclusions. Any conclusions on the safe use of sewage sludge in agriculture have to be drawn carefully, as the studies performed until now have been limited. Further studies are required, and before final statements can be drawn, it is imminent to study a larger variety of common crops and the effect sewage sludge application may have on a possible accumulation of organic contaminants in the crops. Furthermore, a larger variety of organic contaminants need to be studied and special focus should be given to contaminants newly introduced into the environment. Besides investigating possible plant uptake of organic contaminants, the fate of these compounds in soil after sludge application need to be monitored too. Here, special attention has to be given to studies on degradation and the formation of degradation products, to weathering and to leaching effects on groundwater, to the application of different crops on the same field (crop rotation), to the use of full-width tillage and strip tillage, and to long term application of sewage sludge on the soil.Recommendations and Perspectives. There are environmental, political as well as economical incentives to increase the agricultural application of sludge. However, such usage should be performed with care as there are also ways in which sludge fertilisation could harm the environment and human health. Recently, a new European COST Action (859) has been established covering the field of food safety and improved food quality. Part of the Action is dealing with the application of sewage sludge in agriculture. Before any political and economical measures can be taken, the pros and cons have to be sufficiently investigated on a scientific level first.

J		Article		Phosphorus and nitrogen turnover and risk of waterborne phosphorus emissions in crop rotations on a clay soil in southwest Sweden		Ulen, B.

Soil Use and Management		2005	JUN 2005	21	2	221-230	221	230	English						Nutrient losses from arable land are important contributors to eutrophication of surface waters, and phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) usually act together to regulate production of Cyanobacteria. Concentrations and losses of both nutrients in drainage water from pipe drains were studied and compared in 15 crop rotations on a clay soil in southwest Sweden. Special emphasis was placed on P and it was possible to evaluate critical components of the crop rotations by flow-proportional water sampling. Total P concentrations in drainage water were generally small (0.04-0.18 mg L-1), but during two wetter years out of six, high P concentrations were measured following certain management practices, including ploughing-in lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) and fertilizing in advance without incorporation into the soil to meet the needs of several subsequent crops. This resulted in average flow-weighted concentrations of total P between 0.3 and 0.7 mg L-1. In crop rotations containing green manures, green fallow or leguminous leys, there was also a risk for increased P losses after these crops were ploughed in. The losses increased in the order: cash crops < dairy with grass < dairy with lucerne < monoculture with barley < organic farming with cattle slurry < stockless organic farming with green manure. P balances varied between -9 and +8 kg P ha(-1) and N balances between +4 and +35 kg N ha(-1). The balances were not related to actual leaching losses. Phosphorus losses in drainage from set-aside were 67-82% of those from cash crops grown in ploughed and P-fertilized soil at the same site, indicating a high background P loss from this clay soil.

The causes of the heavy infections remained unclear. Within the frame of an European research project (ENV4-CT98-0705) these microbial infections were documented and analyzed. By scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and dissecting microscope analysis of mural painting fragments it was shown that the main biofilm formers were microscopic fungi with strong pigment development. Thirty-two fungal and 139 heterotrophic bacterial isolates were obtained by cultivation methods. Most of the fungi (32 isolates) were characterized by morphological methods and nutritional physiology (BIOLOG system) and identified as Acremonium, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Fusarium and other imperfect fungal genera among which several melanized Mycelia sterilia. Representative bacterial strains were analyzed by 16S rDNA sequencing, the majority of bacteria belonged to the genera Arthrobacter, Bacillus and Bacillus-related genera. Isolated strains (both fungal and bacterial) belong to spore formers and thus could have been potentially stimulated to grow only by the transfer to the growth medium. The results of SEM analysis, cultivation experiments and visualization of microbial activity, confirm the hypothesis that the current microbial community is inactive and represent a stagnant microbial community developed after drastic environmental changes caused by an unfortunate conservation treatment.

J		Article		Bacterial traits, organism mass, and numerical abundance in the detrital soil food web of Dutch agricultural grasslands		Mulder, Christian (christian.mulder@rivm.nl) ; Cohen, Joel E.; Setala, Heikki; Bloem, Jaap; Breure, Anton M.									Ecology Letters		2005	January 2005	8	1	80-90	80	90	English	print					This paper compares responses to environmental stress of the ecophysiological traits of organisms in the detrital soil food webs of grasslands in the Netherlands, using the relationship between average body mass M and numerical abundance N. The microbial biomass and biodiversity of belowground fauna were measured in 110 grasslands on sand, 85 of them farmed under organic, conventional and intensive management. Bacterial cell volume and abundance and electrophoretic DNA bands as well as bacterial activity in the form of either metabolic quotient (qCO2) or microbial quotient (Cmic/Corg) predicted the response of microorganisms to stress. For soil fauna, the logarithm of body mass log(M) was approximately linearly related to the logarithm of numerical abundance log(N) with slope near -1, and the regression slope and the proportion of predatory species were lower in intensive agroecosystems (more reduced substrates with higher energy content). Linear regression of log(N) on log(M) had slope not far from -3/4. The approach to monitoring data illustrated in this paper could be useful in assessing land-use quality.

J		Article		Implications of transgenic, insecticidal plants for insect and plant biodiversity		Hilbeck, Angelika									Perspectives in Plant Ecology Evolution and Systematics		2001		4	1	43-61	43	61	English	print					Genetically modified plants are widely grown predominantly in North America and to a lesser extent in Australia, Argentina and China but their regions of production are expected to spread soon beyond these limited areas also reaching Europe where great controversy over the application of gene technology in agriculture persists. Currently, several cultivars of eight major crop plants are commercially available including canola, corn, cotton, potato, soybean, sugar beet, tobacco and tomato, but many more plants with new and combined multiple traits are close to registration. While currently agronomic traits (herbicide resistance, insect resistance) dominate, traits conferring "quality" traits (altered oil compositions, protein and starch contents) will begin to dominate within the next years. However, economically the most promising future lies in the development and marketing of crop plants expressing pharmaceutical or "nutraceuticals" (functional foods), and plants that express a number of different genes. From this it is clear that future agricultural and, ultimately, also natural ecosystems will be challenged by the large-scale introduction of entirely novel genes and gene products in new combinations at high frequencies all of which will have unknown impacts on their associated complex of non-target organisms, i.e. all organisms that are not targeted by the insecticidal protein. In times of severe global decline of biodiversity, pro-active precaution is necessary and careful consideration of the likely expected effects of transgenic plants on biodiversity of plants and insects is mandatory. In this paper possible implications of non-target effects for insect and plant biodiversity are discussed and a case example of such non-target effects is presented. In a multiple year research project, tritrophic and bitrophic effects of transgenic corn, expressing the gene from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt-corn) that codes for the high expression of an insecticidal toxin (Cry1Ab), on the natural enemy species, Chrysoperla carnea (the green lacewing), was investigated. In these laboratory trials, we found prey-mediated effects of transgenic Bt-corn causing significantly higher mortality of C. carnea larvae. In further laboratory trials, we confirmed that the route of exposure (fed directly or via a herbivorous prey) and the origin of the Bt (from transgenic plants or incorporated into artificial diet) strongly influenced the degree of mortality. In choice feeding trials where C. carnea could choose between Spodoptera littoralis fed transgenic Bt-corn and S. littoralis fed non-transgenic corn, larger instars showed a significant preference for S. littoralis fed non-transgenic corn while this was not the case when the choice was between Bt- and isogenic corn fed aphids. Field implications of these findings could be multifold but will be difficult to assess because they interfere in very intricate ways with complex ecosystem processes that we still know only very little about. The future challenge in pest management will be to explore how transgenic plants can be incorporated as safe and effective components of IPM systems and what gene technology can contribute to the needs of a modern sustainable agriculture that avoids or reduces adverse impacts on biodiversity? For mainly economically motivated resistance management purposes, constitutive high expression of Bt-toxins in transgenic plants is promoted seeking to kill almost 100% of all susceptible (and if possible heterozygote resistant) target pest insects. However, for pest management this is usually not necessary. Control at or below an established economic injury level is sufficient for most pests and cropping systems. It is proposed that partially or moderately resistant plants expressing quantitative rather than single gene traits and affecting the target pest sub-lethally may provide a more meaningful contribution of agricultural biotechnology to modern sustainable agriculture. Some examples of such plants produced through conventional breeding are presented. Non-target effects may be less severe allowing for better incorporation of these plants into IPM or biological control programs using multiple control strategies, thereby, also reducing selection pressure for pest resistance development.

J		Article		Effect of rotation, nitrogen fertilization and management of crop residues on some chemical, microbiological and biochemical properties of soil		Perucci, P.; Bonciarelli, U.; Santilocchi, R.; Bianchi, A. A.									Biology and Fertility of Soils		1997		24	3	311-316	311	316	English						A long-term experiment, which started in 1971 near Perugia, central Italy, was performed to investigate the, effect of different crop residue management practices and rotation systems on some soil properties. Twenty years after the beginning of the experiment, chemical (organic C, total N, humified organic C, humic and fulvic acids), microbiological and biochemical parameters (microbial biomass, global hydrolase activity, dehydrogenase and catalase activities) were investigated. Two crop residue management practices were used in the experiment, i.e. removal (RCR soils) and burial (BCR soils). These treatments were factorially combined with eight rotation systems, i.e. five maize-wheat rotations of different lengths (M-1W, M-2W, M-3W, M-4W and M-5W) and three continuous wheat systems with different fertilization inputs, from 150 to 250 kg N ha-1. Soil samples were collected in the spring of 1991 for chemical determinations, and in the spring and autumn of 1992, 1993 and 1994, for microbiological and biochemical determinations. All soil chemical, microbiological and biochemical parameters investigated showed significant differences depending on the management of the crop residues. The BCR soils showed more favorable characteristics. In contrast, few significant effects were observed in relation to rotation and N-fertilization treatment. Significant correlations were found between organic-C content and all microbiological and biochemical parameters, as well as between the microbiological and biochemical parameters themselves, indicating that organic-C content plays an important role in determining the level of soil enzyme activity and, consequently, of soil fertility. This experiment showed that burying crop residues in soil can be considered good agronomic practice, which may help limit the gradual depletion of soil organic matter and improve the chemical properties of the soil.

Experiments included three programmes of wheat cultivation: 1 - Conventional winter wheat protection based on recommendations for commercial fields; 2 - Integrated pest management programme where the control of diseases and insect pests was carried out on the background of thresholds of harmfulness/noxiousness, and weather forecasts; 3 Untreated, without protection against diseases and pests. Two levels of nitrogen fertilization were applied in the experiments (120 kg N/ha and 170 kg N/ha) and the newest plant protection products were used for controlling fungal pathogens and noxious insects. The occurrence of diseases and insect pests, as well as beneficial entomofauna was determined in relation to each experimental variant, and occurring changes were analysed. Effectiveness of disease and pest control were calculated. Grain yield and its quality were determined and economical profitability for both conventional and integrated programmes calculated. It was shown that a high profitability can be obtained through the application of integrated pest management, as a result of correct choice and application of plant protection products, as well as proper choice of wheat cultivars and appropriate nitrogen fertilization.

Livestock Science		2006	OCT 2006	104	1-2	193-202	193	202	English						A key element in the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CA-P) will be a single farm payment system that is linked to compliance with rules on, for instance hygiene standards. However, there are no recommended methods for assessing the hygiene proficiency of pig production farms. The present study was undertaken to develop a method for this purpose. A first implementation was done on pilot scale; with a set of both conventional and organic pig farms (N=15). Fifty hygiene-related factors were selected, especially with reference to the possible proliferation of enteric pathogens Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. The factors were allocated into 8 evaluation categories: (1) general production management, (2) animal density, (3) the outdoor area for pigs, (4) pest and pet animals, (5) general hygiene in the piggery, (6) pen hygiene, (7) feed production hygiene, and (8) feeding hygiene. A farm questionnaire and a supplementary on-site observation form were devised, and one arbitrary scale of hygiene points assigned for each factor. In addition to the mailed questionnaires, one person subsequently visited all the farms, perused the questionnaire with the owners and completed the observation form. The hygiene scores of the farms in each evaluation category were compared both without weighting and with weighting based on expert opinions. The method proved to be feasible and applicable to different types of production. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J		Article		Ecological and economic conditions of organic coffee production in Latin America and Papua New Guinea		Puelschen, Ludwig; Lutzeyer, Hans-Joerg									Angewandte Botanik		1993		67	5-6	204-208	204	208	English						Prospects and limitations of organic coffee growing are described under the presently increasing demand for this produce in Europe and North America. In 1991 the consumption of organic coffee, certified according to US-statues was equivalent to 0.18% of the total coffee market in the western world (2.9 mio t green coffee). In the most important European countries this market is expected to rise to a trade volume of at least 4400 t in 1995. Agronomic limitations of organic coffee production mainly relate to balanced nutrient supply. While low yielding plantations may cover their nitrogen requirements through leguminous shade trees, systems of high production intensity must add organic fertilizer, preferably compost materials. Preparation and transport of such materials - if available in required quantities - may render organic plantations uneconomic. Examples for the crucial impact of site and management factors on the severity of pests and diseases like the coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei) and coffee rust (Hemileia vastatrix) are given. The importance of organic coffee growers' and marketing organizations for longterm profitability and sustainability of such coffee production systems is stressed. Chances for organic coffee cultivation as an alternative to coca growing in Latin America are discussed.	Inst. Pflanzenproduktion Tropen Subtropen, Univ.

Laws and administrative regulations in most European countries mainly apply to catching restrictions. The authors propose instead a management strategy based on a liberal and flexible catching policy, efficient exploitation of crayfish populations and intensive distribution of small crayfish from dense populations and from crayfish farms. Continuous stocking in new water bodies and waters ravaged by crayfish plague guarantees maximum distribution of crayfish.The benefits and disadvantages of different regulations are fisted and practical problems arising are considered. Some recent studies on crayfish population dynamics in Finland are also presented.	Erkamo, Esa; Evo State Fisheries Aquaculture Res.

Folia Microbiologica		2004		49	4	484-490	484	490	English	print					Nineteen clinical isolates of Candida albicans and C. dubliniensis were isolated from patients (majority of them HIV-positive) in Slovakia, Brazil, Thailand and Japan. Species discrimination was performed by using growth on CHROMagar Candida, commercial biochemical set API 20C AUX, germ-tube test in human serum, growth at 42 and 45 degreeC on Sabouraud-dextrose agar as well as on CHROMagar Candida, assimilation of D-Xylose and methyl U-D-glucoside by glass-tube test, and production of chlamydospores. These tests were completed by PCR using Cd-oligo2/F and Cd-oligo2/R primer pair specific for C. dubliniensis. Six clinical isolates were confirmed to be C. dubliniensis, remaining 13 strains were determined as C. albicans. The use of conventional method showed that the determination is markedly influenced by personal evaluation suggesting the necessity of using the combination of many tests to obtain correct results comparing with accurate and rapid PCR assay. For discrimination between C. albicans and C. dubliniensis we recommend the combination of primo-cultivation on CHROMagar, followed by germ-tube test and PCR.

Microbial Ecology		1998	Dec., 1998	36	3	303-315	303	315	English	print					In this study, two different agricultural soils were investigated: one organic omegail and one sandy soil, from Stend (south of Bergen), Norway. The sandy soil was a field frequently tilled and subjected to crop rotations. The organic soil was permanent grazing land, infrequently tilled. Our objective was to compare the diversity of the cultivable bacteria with the diversity of the total bacterial population in soil. About 200 bacteria, randomly isolated by standard procedures, were investigated. The diversity of the cultivable bacteria was described at phenotypic, phylogenetic, and genetic levels by applying phenotypical testing (Biolog) and molecular methods, such as amplified rDNA restriction analysis (ARDRA); hybridization to oligonucleotide probes; and REP-PCR. The total bacterial diversity was determined by reassociation analysis of DNA isolated from the bacterial fraction of environmental samples, combined with ARDR.A and DGGE analysis. The relationship between the diversity of cultivated bacteria and the total bacteria was elucidated. Organic soil exhibited a higher diversity for all analyses performed then the sandy soil. Analysis of cultivable bacteria resulted in different resolution levels and revealed a high biodiversity within the population of cultured isolates. The difference between the two agricultural soils was significantly higher when the total bacterial population was analyzed than when the cultivable population was. Thus, analysis of microbial diversity must ultimately embrace the entire microbial community DNA, rather than DNA from cultivable bacteria.	Ovreas, L.; Dep.

Estuarine Coastal and Shelf Science		2008	AUG 20 2008	79	2	187-203	187	203	English						Barbamarco Lagoon (area = 7 km(2)) is in the Po River Delta, adjoining the Northern Adriatic Sea, and supports a commercially valuable clam (Tapes philippinarum) fishery. This study investigated interactions of the lagoon with adjacent coastal waters and inland riverine inputs by modelling both the lagoon and the Northern Adriatic Sea, using a coupled three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic-ecological model (ELCOM-CAEDYM) adapted to include the clam population. The clam model accounted for carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) biomass in the benthos through parameterisations for filtration, excretion, egestion, respiration, mortality, and harvesting. Multiple clam size classes were included in a new population dynamics sub-model. Output from the coupled model was validated against hydrodynamic and water quality data from intensive field sampling and routine monitoring. Time scales of tidal flushing, primary production and clam grazing were investigated with the model to demonstrate that food supply to clam populations is dominated by phytoplankton inputs from the Northern Adriatic Sea. Effects of clam cultivation on nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton biomass in Barbamarco Lagoon were primarily localised, with strong tidal flushing minimising impacts of clam filtration on lagoon-wide nutrient concentrations at current clam stocking levels. Clam populations were found to alter the cycling of nutrients in the system, causing the lagoon to become a net sink for particulate organic matter and to export dissolved organic matter to the adjacent sea via tidal flushing. Ecosystem health and sensitivity of nutrient cycles to clam cultivation are important considerations for the long term sustainable management and potential expansion of the fishery.

The unfertilized plot, FYM fertilized plots and plots fertilized with equivalent NPK fertilizer contained 0.99%, 1.13% and 1.05% total organic carbon (TOC) respectively. Compared to the unfertilized plot, FYM application resulted in 8.2% higher TOC than equivalent NPK fertilization. The highest TOC was only 1.21%, much lower than expected for a soil containing 21.3% of clay. The quantity of HWC varied depending on the type of fertilization: Compared to control, FYM treatments lead to 29% more HWC than mineral fertilization (FYM: 328 mg kg(-1); NPK: 264 mg kg(-1)). The impact of FYM and equivalent NPK fertilizer on Cmic was contrary. FYM and NPK resulted in 304 and 423 mg kg(-1) C-mic, respectively. The difference was 119 mg kg(-1); 42% as compared to the unfertilized plot. Despite the higher HWC content, FYM treatments lead to significantly less (35%) grain yields than equivalent NPK doses; Cmic content showed closer correlation to grain yields.

Cellular and Molecular Biology (Noisy-Le-Grand)		2001	December, 2001	47	8	1319-1328	1319	1328	English	print					Genetically modified plants (GMP) are massively used on the American continent in Australia and in China, since they represent an unquestionable potential for progress. New attributes are therefore devoted to the human and animal diet, to the facilitating of culture management, to the reducing of the chemical fertilizer and pesticide usage, and to the conquest of new cultural spaces. Considering itself to be flawed by a too hasty plunge into the market, concomitant with sagging evaluations of other innovations, Europe is confronted by a strong societal debate which blocks GMP cultures and orientates the research towards an evaluation of the environmental and public health risks and an evaluation of their economical and sociological impacts. The authors encourage this societal debate in order to arbitrate the presence of transgense in conventional productions and products, to define the accepted rules of responsibility, to decide what is not acceptable, and to involve the more upstream actors and operators of the innovation process, all that keeping in mind the agronomical, ecological and economical repercussions of their decisions.

(thalasso@mail.cinvestav.mx)									Bioresource Technology		2003	July 2003	88	3	259-263	259	263	English	print					Biofiltration is the most commonly used biological gas treatment technology and is extensively used for the treatment of polluted air with gas flow rates of up to 2 X 105 m3/h. It involves a filter bed of organic matter serving both as carrier for microorganisms and as nutrient supplier. Polluted gas passes through the filter bed and is cleaned by biological activity. Biofiltration is not being developed in Latin America as in the USA, Canada or Europe; the main reason probably being the absence of specific technology and of potential organic carriers locally available. Five different agriculture by-products available in Latin America: peanut shells, rice husk, coconut shells, cane bagasse and maize stubble, were chemically, physically and structurally characterized for their potential use as biofilter carrier. It was found that peanut shells could be used as biofilter carrier and therefore would have potential biological application.

J		Article		Cultivable bacterial composition and BIOLOG catabolic diversity of biofilm communities developed on Phragmites australis		Rusznyak, Anna; Vladar, Peter; Molnar, Piroska; Reskone, Maria N.; Kiss, Gabor; Marialigeti, Karoly; Borsodi, Andrea K. (bandrea@ludens.elte.hu)									Aquatic Botany		2008	APR 2008	88	3	211-218	211	218	English						Biofilm samples formed on submerged young and old stems of reed, Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin ex Steudel were taken during summer at different sites of Lake Velencei, Hungary. BIOLOG GN microplates were used to analyze the patterns of sole carbon source utilizations by microbial communities. From the carbon sources, carbohydrates and amino acids were preferred by all microbial communities. In the case of the old reed stem samples, higher number of carbohydrates, carboxylic acids and polymers were used than in young samples. Biofilm bacterial communities from the old reed samples of the nature conservation area of the lake used the highest number of (>= 50% of the available) substrates. In principal component analysis (PCA), the metabolic potential of the microbial communities from the middle open water region of the lake showed the smallest variability. The variability within metabolic potential of the reed stem microbial communities from a given sampling site was the largest in the case of samples originating from the western, reed-covered nature conservation area. A total of 251 bacterial isolates obtained after serial dilutions and plating onto different media were characterized by traditional phenotypic tests. The strains showed high activities mainly in the hydrolysis of certain biopolymers (gelatine and casein). PCA was used to evaluate the phenotypic variability of strain groups of different sampling sites. The two open water regions were similar to each other, and separated from the western reed covered part of the lake. Similarly to the BIOLOG community-level physiological profiles, strain groups of the young and old reed stem samples originating from the nature conservation area had the largest metabolic potential. On the basis of 16S rDNA sequence analysis, 23 representative strains with different ARDRA patterns were identified. The cultivation-based investigations of bacterial diversity showed characteristic differences in the number of identified taxa in connection with the sampling sites. No characteristic differences could be observed according to medium or sample type (young, first year and more than 1-year old stems) among the identified species. 16S rDNA sequence comparisons resulted in the identification of the genera Aureobacterium, Arthrobacter, Kocuria, Microbacterium, Micrococcus, Rhodococcus, Bacillus, Marinibacillus, Rhodobacter, Defluvibacter, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Serratia and Aeromonas. The results of the cultivation-based and BIOLOG investigations revealed characteristic differences in the bacterial community composition and activities of the open water region and the reed covered nature conservation part of the lake.

J		Article		Soil microbial activities in Luvisols and Anthrosols during 9 years of region-typical tillage and fertilisation practices in northern Germany.		Dilly, Oliver (oliver@ecology.uni-kiel.de) ; Blume, Hans-Peter; Munch, Jean Charles									Biogeochemistry (Dordrecht)		2003	October 2003	65	3	319-339	319	339	English	print					In order to evaluate soil functions of contemporary agricultural management practices, the adjustment of microbial biomass and C and N mineralisation capacities was monitored during 9 years following the implementation of conventional and reduced tillage, and mineral N and pig slurry fertilisation systems. Soil microbial biomass content and microbial activities decreased continuously from initial values. The decrease was slowed by slurry application, compared to either no or mineral N fertilisation, and both slurry and mineral N application stimulated soil microbial activities in the long-term. There were no significant differences in microbiological characteristics between conventional and reduced tillage for the 0 to 30 cm soil depth but microbial biomass and activity were highest from 0 to 15 cm depth under reduced tillage. Changes in several microbial properties became evident when analysing the whole experiment of 9 years and the soil unit is also of importance as shown by higher microbial activity level in Anthrosols in comparison to Luvisols.

Gram negative, hemolytic, oxidase (+) and catalase (+) bacterial colonies were applied to the study. Identification of bacterial colonies was done by conventional biochemical method and API ID 20E panel (BioMerieux-France). Molecular epidemiological discrimination of the isolates was done by AP-PCR. Aeromonas spp. was detected in 6 of 148 (4%) tap water samples from 8 different locations. Five isolates were identified asAeromonas hydrophila and one isolate was identified as Vibrio fluvialis by conventional biochemical method. These data were also confirmed by API 20E panel. One of 6 isolates was resistant to gentamicin, 2 of 6 isolates were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 4 of 6 isolates were resistant to ampicillin and ampicillin-sulbactam and all of 6 isolates were resistant to cephalothin. All isolates were found to be susceptible to amikacin, aztreonam, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin. All 6 strains of Aeromonas were discriminated by AP-PCR and were determined that all isolates were from different genotypic sources.Although the frequency of the isolates was under the standard limits, the results indicate that hemolytic A. hydrophila are present in municipally treated tap water samples in Mersin City. While all strains were genotypically distinct, all of them were resistant to first generation beta lactam antibiotics tested in this study. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

Consequently a reliable risk assessment of human Toxoplasmosis caused by ingesting raw or improperly cooked pork and pork products is not available. The aim of this study was to show current data on T. gondii prevalence in German pig farms. In four pig farms with different management systems (three conventional, one organic) 100 animals each were selected and tested for T. gondii antibodies. The test was done four times during the period from birth to slaughtering. In one farm 20 mother sows were tested additionally. The slaughtered pigs from conventional farms showed seroprevalences between 0 and 15.2% (mean value 5.6%). At the organic system T. gondii antibodies were not detected. All slaughtered seropositive pigs (6 months old) were tested negatively at the age of 9 weeks, but shortly after birth high titres of T. gondii antibodies had been detected in the same animals.Comparing the results gained in different seasons significant more pigs were found to be infected during the autumn/winter than in the spring/summer period. In order to assess the current risk of Toxoplasmosis more pig farms should be tested. From the point of view of consumer protection the detection of highly infected pig herds is necessary.

European Journal of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases		1994		13	10	805-811	805	811	English						The beta-lactamases of seven strains of Aerononas salmonicida subsp. achromogenes resistant to amoxicillin (MIC gt 1024 mg/l) and responsible for furunculosis in farmed Atlantic salmon in Scotland were examined to establish the mechanisms of beta-lactam resistance. Separation of a cell-free extract on an isoelectric focusing gel stained with the chromogenic cephalosporin nitrocerfin showed the presence of two beta-lactamases, one with a pI of 7.9 and the other with a pl of 6.0. Hydrolysis assays of cell-free extracts of these strains demonstrated carbapenemase, penicillinase and cephalosporinase activity. However, when the beta-lactamases were separated by anion exchange chromatography, the carbapenemase activity could not be retrieved in either of the peak fractions containing the separated enzymes that had been visualised by nitrocefin. Consequently, a novel carbapenemase was discovered which cannot be detected with nitrocefin.	Amyes, S. G. B.; Dep. Med. Microbiol., Med. Sch., Univ.

J		Article		Diversity, occurrence, and life characteristics of natural entomopathogenic nematode populations from La Rioja (Northern Spain) under different agricultural management and their relationships with soil factors		Campos-Herrera, Raquel; Gomez-Ros, Jose Manuel; Escuer, Miguel; Cuadra, Luis; Barrios, Laura; Gutierrez, Carmen (carmen.g@ccma.csic.es)									Soil Biology & Biochemistry		2008	JUN 2008	40	6	1474-1484	1474	1484	English						Natural entomopathogenic nematode (EPN) populations were surveyed in La Rioja (Northern Spain) during two consecutive years (2003-2005) to study their diversity, occurrence, and life characteristics under different agricultural management representing natural areas and perennial and annual crops from organic and conventional systems. Native EPN species and strains were identified using morphological and molecular characteristics. Virulence, infection cycle length and reproductive potential were assessed using Galleria mellonella larvae. The EPN occurrence was evaluated through abundance, recovery frequency, larval mortality percentage and EPN population density. EPNs were also related to selected soil physical and chemical variables as well as to some soil pollutants such as heavy metals and organochlorine pesticide residues. Only two steinernematids species were identified: Steinernema feltiae was observed throughout all seasons from natural and agricultural areas and Steinernema carpocapsae in summer and autumn of 2004 from perennial crops only. The virulence of native strains was lower than other previously isolated Spanish strain from natural areas or crop field edges. EPN abundance and recovery frequency indicated that habitat type might influence EPNs occurrence stronger than seasonality with the intensity of agricultural management inversely affecting their distribution. Moreover, clay, P2O5, Zn, Cu and hexachlorobenzene contents negatively correlating with EPN population density. We consider that agricultural management should be taken into account if EPNs are going to be used as biological control agents. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The herd prevalence of antibodies to Y. enterocolitica in multiplying herds (56.1%) was similar to the level in the conventional farrow-to-finish herds. An epidemiological study in conventional pig herds demonstrated that farrow-to-finish production (odds ratio, OR= 0.15) was an important protective factor. Using under-pressure ventilation (OR= 0.33) and manual feeding of slaughter pigs (OR = 0.44) also lowered the herd prevalence. The most expressed risk factor was using an own farm vehicle for transport of slaughter pigs to abattoirs (OR = 12.92). Separation between clean and unclean section in herds (OR = 2.67), daily observations of a cat with kittens on the farm (OR = 2.41) and using straw bedding for slaughter pigs (OR = 2.25) were other factors that increased the risk. In conclusion, the epidemiological data suggest that it is possible to reduce the herd prevalence of Yersinia enterocolitica O:3 by minimising contact between infected herds and non-infected herds. Further, attempts to reduce the prevalence at the top levels of the breeding pyramids may be beneficial for the industry as a whole. The meat industry may use serological tests as a tool to lower the prevalence in the pig population by limiting the contact between seropositive and seronegative herds. However, because of the high prevalence of Y. enterocolitica in pig herds, a strict slaughter hygiene will remain an important means to reduce carcass contamination with Y. enterocolitica O:3 as well as other pathogenic micro-organisms.

J		Article	Literature Review	Control of Fusarium head blight in wheat under Irish growing conditions: Current situation and future prospects.		Dardis, J. V.; Walsh, E. J. (edward.walsh@ucd.ie)									Biology and Environment		2002	November 2002	102B	2	93-103	93	103	English	print					Fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat has become one of the most important crop diseases in small-grain cereal production. The FHB pathogen lowers grain yield and quality, and under favourable conditions it can also produce mycotoxins that pose a serious risk to animal and human health. Because environmental factors play a significant role in the spread of FHB, it is essential to evaluate control strategies under Irish growing conditions. This paper reviews the findings of the first major field research project to investigate control of Fusarium head blight in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in Ireland. We examined two approaches to controlling the disease: a short-term approach based on the use of fungicides and a longer-term approach based on the development of resistant cultivars by conventional plant-breeding techniques. The results show that a satisfactory level of control can be achieved with fungicides. We succeeded in identifying a number of lines with high levels of resistance to FHB under Irish field conditions. It is hoped that these resistant genes can be introgressed into a more adapted background with the ultimate objective of developing a resistant variety for Irish wheat-growers.	Walsh, E.

Water Science and Technology		1997	Oct.-Nov., 1997	36	8-9	271-276	271	276	English	print					Results of an urban runoff monitoring program are presented. Combined sewer overflow (CSO) samples were analysed for suspended solids (SS), five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), total chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Ni), nitrogen compound, biological and microbiological constituents. Study results indicate that CSOs largely contribute to the organic pollution of the local receiving streams. Cumulative pollution impacts were caused by sedimentation of suspended solids in the waste water treatment plant effluent discharged throughout the year. However, comparison of the various pollution sources indicated that pollution problems in the receiving waters were caused not only by the municipal effluents from the Town of Malacky, but also by diffuse, agricultural pollution characterised by elevated loads of nutrients (N and P), as well as by release of heavy metals (mainly Zn) from the surrounding area.

Robustness of the applied technique under routine conditions was good and corresponding quality control information is given. The wheat samples were cultivated on a long-term field trial in Switzerland with three different farming systems (biodynamic, bioorganic and conventional). DON was detected in 100 %, NIV in 67 % and HT-2 in 25 % of all wheat samples. Only 48 % of the detectable DON concentrations were above the limit of quantification (LOQ, 50 mug/kg). The range varied between 10-206 mug/kg. NIV and HT-2 were detected at concentrations around or below their LOQ (NIV: 100 mug/kg; HT-2: 10 mug/kg). Statistically significant differences between the three farming systems could not be found. However, there were some indications that wheat from organic farming had lower DON contaminations than that from conventional one.

J		Article		Methane oxidation in soils of two long-term fertilization experiments in Germany		Huetsch, Birgit W.									Soil Biology and Biochemistry		1996		28	6	773-782	773	782	English						Oxidation of CH-4 was measured in intact soil cores collected from two arable sites located in the low rainfall area of central Germany. The soils were a loamy sand (Halle) and a loess black-earth (Bad Lauchstadt), treated with different mineral and organic fertilizers for 116 and 92 y, respectively. Soil cores were kept in sealed jars at 25 degree C for 48 h. The decrease in the initial CH-4 concentration (10 mu-l l-1) followed first-order-kinetics and by log-transformation, individual oxidation rates could be calculated for each treatment and tested for significant differences. At the sandy site mineral N application caused a significant inhibition of CH-4 oxidation with rates of 2.44 and 0.70 mg C m-2 d-1 in the PK (phosphate + potassium) and NPK (nitrogen + PK) treatments, respectively, under continuous rye, and 1.09 and 0.11 mg C m-2 d-1 in the same treatments under continuous maize. CH-4 oxidation in the plot with long-term farmyard manure (FYM) applications was intermediate. A plot where long-term FYM application ceased 40 y ago showed no residual effect on CH-4 oxidation. The CH-4 oxidation rate was generally lower under maize than under rye with a mean of 0.31 compared to 0.85 mg C m-2 d-1. For the loess black-earth the effect of fertilization on CH-4 oxidation differed depending on pH. With pH 8 mineral and organic N applications did not affect CH-4 oxidation. However, at pH 6 mineral N was significantly inhibitory to methanotrophs with a mean rate of 0.04 vs 0.38 mg C m-2 d-1 without N fertilization. Extremely large FYM applications (100 and 200 t ha-1 y-1) to this loess soil inhibited CH-4 oxidation significantly. It is assumed that in the sandy soil as well as in the acid subplot of the loess soil the suitable sites for methanotrophic bacteria were restricted and application of mineral N resulted in competition between methane- and ammonia-oxidizers. Thus, earlier results on the inhibitory effect of mineral N on CH-4 oxidation were confirmed. However, there were exceptions where N fertilizer had no adverse effect upon CH-4 uptake and interacting factors (e.g. pH) played a major role.	Inst.

J		Article		Indigenous and introduced populations of Agaricus bisporus, the cultivated button mushroom, in eastern and western Canada: Implications for population biology, resource management, and conservation of genetic diversity		Kerrigan, Richard W.; Carvalho, Daisy B.; Horgen, Paul A.; Anderson, James B.									Canadian Journal of Botany		1995		73	12	1925-1938	1925	1938	English						Agaricus bisporus is known from field collections in several parts of southern Canada and the border states of Washington and Idaho. In Ontario, the species is associated with urban horticultural sites, agricultural areas, and thoroughfares. In British Columbia, Washington, and Idaho, the species is less well documented but occurs in habitats similar to those in Ontario. All studied isolates from these two regions were genotypically similar to those collected in Europe and also to a representative sample of cultivar isolates believed to be of European origin. In contrast, a population from forests of Picea in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta had genotypes that are very different from European and cultivar groups, including the putatively introduced populations in other parts of Canada. To a lesser extent, the Albertan individuals also differed from three other isolated natural populations, two in California and one in Israel. Two of 35 isolates from Alberta had nuclear genotypes that were partially or entirely consistent with European ancestry, indicating that foreign (probably cultivar) germ plasm has become established in the native habitat. Thirty of 35 isolates from the Alberta field sample had one of six mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes known only from Alberta; the remaining five had an mtDNA type known from cultivar strains. However, nuclear genotypic similarity to other Albertan or European-cultivar isolates was not significantly correlated with presence or absence of this latter mtDNA type. The genetic diversity represented by the previously unknown Albertan population, and to a lesser extent by the heirloom varietal lineages and their derivatives that have become established in Ontario, British Columbia, Washington, and Idaho, is an important resource for breeders of this valuable fungal crop species. Threats to resource populations of this species, and possible responses, are discussed.	Kerrigan, Richard W.; Res. Dep., Sylvan Spawn Lab.

J		Article		Enhanced power of QTL detection for Fusarium head blight resistance in wheat by means of codominant scoring of hemizygous molecular markers		Klahr, Anja; Mohler, Volker; Herz, Markus; Wenzel, Gerhard; Schwarz, Gerhard (gschwarz@wzw.tum.de)									Molecular Breeding		2004	May 2004	13	4	289-300	289	300	English	print					Based on different marker information content mapping of QTLs for Fusarium head blight resistance in wheat was compared with regard to number and consistency of detected QTLs as well as QTL positions and effects. Therefore, two linkage maps, obtained by 'dominant' and 'codominant genotyping' of hemizygous markers, were constructed with 211 AFLPs, 37 SSRs and the barley RGA marker XaACT/CAA. The 'codominant marker set' comprised 59% codominant markers, whereas the 'dominant map' consisted of only 13%. A segregating wheat population of 94 F4-RILs was used for QTL analysis. Fusarium head blight resistance was estimated in field trials in six environments. Conventional 'dominant marker scoring' found seven QTLs. The phenotypic variations explained by QTLs detected in single environment analyses ranged from 11.1 to 44.6%. QTL analysis performed with the 'codominant marker set' confirmed not only all QTL positions as revealed by 'dominant QTL analysis', but also 12 additional QTLs were found. QTLs in single environments explained 36.3 up to 55.7% of the phenotypic variation. In the QTL analysis across all environments, none of the QTLs could be confirmed using 'dominant marker scoring'. However, by 'codominant QTL analysis' environment-specific QTLs were retrieved. STS marker XaACT/CAA was found to be significantly associated with FHB resistance only by 'codominant scoring'. Support intervals of QTLs commonly found in both marker sets averaged to 10.3 cM in the 'dominant QTL analysis', whereas the length was shortened to 8.9 cM by 'codominant genotyping'. The advantages of extracting codominant information from dominant markers are discussed.

J		Article		Short-term effects of dairy slurry amendment on carbon sequestration and enzyme activities in a temperate grassland.		Bol, R. (roland.bol@bbsrc.ac.uk) ; Kandeler, E.; Amelung, W.; Glaser, B.; Marx, M. C.; Preedy, N.; Lorenz, K.									Soil Biology & Biochemistry		2003	November 2003	35	11	1411-1421	1411	1421	English	print					Land application of animal wastes from intensive grassland farming has resulted in growing environmental problems relating to greenhouse gas emissions, ammonia volatilisation, and nitrate and phosphorus leaching into surface and groundwater. We examined the short-term effects of dairy slurry amendment on carbon sequestration and enzyme activities in a temperate grassland (Southwest England). Slurry was collected from cows fed either on perennial ryegrass (C3) or maize (C4) silages. Fifty m3 ha-1 of each of the obtained C3 or C4 slurries (delta13C=-30.7 and -21.3permill, respectively) were applied to a C3 pasture soil with delta13C of -30.0+-0.2permill. We found that water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) content was two to three times higher in the slurry amended plots compared with the unamended control. No significant change in the soil microbial biomass (SMB) carbon content was observed in the four weeks (772 h) following slurry application. Natural abundance 13C isotope analysis suggested a rapid initial incorporation (>25% within 2 h of application) of slurry-derived C in the SMB-C and WSOC pools of the 0-2 cm layer. Linear relationships were found between slurry-derived C in the whole soil, SMB, and WSOC for the 0-2 cm depth in the soil. Applied slurry-derived C was sequestered in the SMB pool in two phases. The first phase (0-48 h) was dominated by the incorporation of labile slurry C from the liquid phase, whereas beyond 48 h slurry-derived C was mainly from less mobile particulate C. No significant differences between treatments were found for invertase and xylanase. Urease activity was always higher in slurry treatments.

J	12118518	Article		Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in broiler flocks 5 years after the avoparcin ban		Heuer, O. E.; Pedersen, K.; Andersen, J. S.; Madsen, M.									Microbial Drug Resistance		2002	Summer, 2002	8	2	133-138	133	138	English	print					The glycopeptide growth promoter avoparcin was banned from animal production in Denmark in 1995. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in broiler flocks in the absence of the selective pressure exerted by the use of avoparcin. One hundred sixty-two broiler flocks from rearing systems with different histories of avoparcin exposure were investigated for the presence of VRE. Using a direct selective plating procedure, VRE were isolated from 104 of 140 (74.3%) broiler flocks reared in broiler houses previously exposed to avoparcin on conventional and extensive indoor broiler farms. In contrast, only 2 of 22 (9.1%) organic broiler flocks reared on free-range farms with no history of previous exposure to avoparcin were VRE-positive. Furthermore, the occurrence of VRE over time in flocks reared in broiler houses previously exposed to avoparcin was investigated. Results obtained by direct selective plating showed no significant decrease in the proportion of VRE-positive flocks during the study period (1998-2001). This study demonstrated the extensive occurrence of VRE in broiler flocks more than 5 years after the avoparcin ban in Denmark, and indicates that VRE may persist in the absence of the selective pressure exerted by avoparcin. The results differ markedly from previously published Danish surveillance data on VRE in broilers. This may reflect differences in isolation procedures.	Heuer, O.

Neil; Zuskin, Eugenija; Vrcic-Keglevic, Mladenka; Ebling, Zdravko; Senta, Ankica									Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine		2001	October, 2001	43	10	905-913	905	913	English	print					This investigation was designed to study respiratory problems in farmworkers. To better define the consequences of this work environment on respiratory health, 814 farmworkers (738 male and 76 female) were studied. The mean age of the men in this study was 38 years, and the mean duration of their employment was 15 years. For women, the mean age was 44 years and the mean duration of their employment was 10 years. Of the men, 56.5% were regular smokers, and 23.7% of the women were regular smokers. A group of 635 control workers without significant exposure to air pollutants were matched by sex, age, employment, and smoking habit. The prevalence of chronic symptoms among male farmworkers was greater (P<0.01) than among male control subjects for chronic cough (24.8% vs 11.4%), chronic phlegm (22.8% vs 9.1%), and chronic bronchitis (20.1% vs 7.4%). Among women farmworkers, a significant difference was noted with controls for chest tightness (farmworkers, 21.1%; control subjects, 0%; P<0.001). There was a high prevalence of acute symptoms among male and female farmworkers. In particular, farmworkers complained of more frequent cough, eye irritation, dyspnea, and throat irritation than did control subjects. For respiratory symptoms in male and female farmworkers, odds ratios were generally significant for smoking, age, and duration of employment. Ventilatory capacity tests were significantly reduced for farmworkers compared with predicted values. Regression analysis of ventilatory capacity tests in male farmworkers as a percentage of predicted values demonstrated significant coefficients for employment and smoking. Our data suggest that farmworkers are exposed to noxious agents that cause respiratory symptoms and ventilatory capacity impairment.	Schachter, E. Neil; Mount Sinai School of Medicine, One Gustave L.

J	15269386	Article		Population structure and genetic variability within isolates of Grapevine fanleaf virus from a naturally infected vineyard in France: evidence for mixed infection and recombination		Vigne, Emmanuelle; Bergdol, Marc; Guyader, Sbastien; Fuchs, Marc (fuchs@colmar.inra.fr)									Journal of General Virology		2004	August 2004	85	Part 8	2435-2445	2435	2445	English	print					The nematode-borne Grapevine fanleaf virus, from the genus Nepovirus in the family Comoviridae, causes severe degeneration of grapevines in most vineyards worldwide. We characterized 347 isolates from transgenic and conventional grapevines from two vineyard sites in the Champagne region of France for their molecular variant composition. The population structure and genetic diversity were examined in the coat protein gene by IC-RT-PCR-RFLP analysis with EcoRI and StyI, and nucleotide sequencing, respectively. RFLP data suggested that 55 % (1191 of 347) of the isolates had a population structure consisting of one predominant variant. Sequencing data of 51 isolates representing the different restrictotypes confirmed the existence of mixed infection with a frequency of 33% (17 of 51)and showed two major predominant haplotypes representing 71 % (60 of 85) of the sequence variants. Comparative nucleotide diversity among population subsets implied a lack of genetic differentiation according to host (transgenic vs conventional) or field site for most restrictotypes (117 of 18 and 13 of 18) and for haplotypes in most phylogenetic groups (seven of eight and six of eight), respectively. Interestingly, five of the 85 haplotypes sequenced had an intermediate divergence (0.036-0.066) between the lower (0.005-0.028) and upper range (0.083-0.138) of nucleotide variability, suggesting the occurrence of homologous RNA recombination. Sequence alignments clearly indicated a mosaic structure for four of these five variants, for which recombination sites were identified and parental lineages proposed. This is the first in-depth characterization of the population structure and genetic diversity in a nepovirus.

Molecular markers were developed and used to investigate the link between wild population decreases or domestication procedures and possible losses of genetic diversity. Simultaneously, a European programme was launched for the management of genetic resources. The Integrative Biology approach shows that changes in genetic diversity are often buffered by the flexibility of rabbit reproductive systems. It appears, also, that all domestic animals belong to a subset of the wild genetic pool of their species without major loss of diversity despite exposure to severe viral infections. Consequently, management of genetic resources for production purposes and conservation or protection of declining Iberian wild populations require different approaches and measures.

J		Article		Soil suppressiveness and functional diversity of the soil microflora in organic farming systems		Postma, Joeke (joeke.postma@wur.nl) ; Schilder, Mirjam T.; Bloem, Jaap; van Leeumen-Haagsma, Wiepie K.									Soil Biology & Biochemistry		2008	SEP 2008	40	9	2394-2406	2394	2406	English						Arable fields of 10 organic farms from different locations in The Netherlands were sampled in three subsequent years. The soil samples were analysed for disease suppressiveness against Rhizoctonia solani AG2.2IIIB in sugar beet, Streptomyces scabies in radish and Verticillium longisporum in oilseed rape. In addition, a variety of microbial, chemical and physical soil characteristics were assessed. All data were correlated by multiple regression and multivariate analyses with the objective to find correlations between soil suppressiveness and biotic or abiotic soil characteristics. Significant differences in soil suppressiveness were found between the fields for all three diseases. Multiple regression indicated a significant correlation between suppressiveness against Rhizoctonia and the number of antagonistic Lysobacter spp., as well as with % active fungi and bacterial diversity. Grass-clover stimulated Rhizoctonia suppression as well as the presence of antagonistic Lysobacter spp. (mainly L. antibioticus and L. gummosus) in clay soils. Streptomyces suppression correlated with the number of antagonistic Streptomyces spp., % of active fungi and bacterial population size. The presence of antagonistic Streptomyces spp. correlated with a high fungal/bacterial biomass ratio. Verticillium suppression was only measured in 2004 and 2005, due to the inconsistent suppressiveness along the years. Nevertheless, a significant correlation with pH, potential nitrogen mineralization and bacterial biomass was found. Bacterial and fungal PCR-denaturing gel electrophoresis fingerprinting of bacterial and fungal communities, in general, did not significantly correlate with disease suppression. Highly significant explanatory factors of the composition of the dominating bacterial and fungal populations were % lutum, pH, C/N quotient, biomass and growth rate of bacteria. Additionally, the % of organic matter and years of organic farming were explaining significantly the composition of the bacterial population. Thus, significant correlations between several soil characteristics and suppressiveness of different soilborne pathogens were found. For two of the three pathogens, suppression correlated with biotic soil characteristics combined with the presence of specific bacterial antagonists, Probably the soil suppressiveness measured in the organic fields is a combined effect of general and specific disease suppression.

APMIS		2001	September, 2001	109	9	581-588	581	588	English	print					The diagnosis of erythema migrans (EM) is not always easy, and reports of culture- or PCR-confirmed diagnosis as well as reports of EM with simultaneous disseminated disease are few. Characteristics and incidence of EM in addition to frequency of early dissemination of B. burgdorferi were studied in the archipelago of South-Western Finland prospectively using questionnaires, skin biopsies and blood samples. Clinical EM was recognized in 82 patients (incidence 148/100000 inhabitants/year). Of skin biopsy samples, 35.5% were positive by PCR (the majority B. garinii), and 21.5% by cultivation (all B. garinii). Of blood samples, 3.8% were positive by PCR, and 7.7% by cultivation. Of the patients, 30.9% were seropositive at the first visit, and 52.9% 3 weeks later. Of the patients with laboratory confirmed diagnosis, the EM lesion was ring-like in 31.8% and homogenous in 65.9%. Dissemination of B. burgdorferi, based on culture or PCR positivity of blood samples, was detected in 11.0% of the patients. The frequency of generalized symptoms was nearly the same in patients with as in those without dissemination (22.2% vs 27.4%). Only 21.4% of the patients with culture-positive EM recalled a previous tick bite at the site of the EM lesion. We conclude that EM lesions are more often homogenous than ring-like. B. burgdorferi may disseminate early without generalized symptoms.

Phytopathology		1998	Aug., 1998	88	8	754-763	754	763	English	print					Natural potato late blight epidemics were studied to assess the relative impact of various inoculum sources of Phytophthora infestans in Southern Flevoland (the Netherlands) from 1994 through 1995. Disease surveys were combined with characterization of isolates for mating type and DNA fingerprint pattern using probe RG57. Seventy-four percent of the commercial potato fields with early foci were clearly associated with nearby infested refuse piles. Characterization of isolates from refuse piles and fields confirmed the association. Infected seed tubers, volunteer plants, and infested allotment gardens appeared to be of minor importance for late blight development in potato fields. Several foci in refuse piles, potato fields, and allotment gardens contained more than one genotype. Due to favorable weather in August 1994, infested organic potato fields became major inoculum sources, resulting in the spread of P. infestans to adjacent conventional potato fields. Analyses of disease gradients, both at the field and regional levels, confirmed the role of the organic fields as mid-season infection sources. The mean slope of field gradients downwind of refuse piles (point sources) was significantly steeper (100-fold difference) than the mean slope of field gradients downwind of organic fields (area sources). The genotypic composition of the P. infestans populations along the gradient and of the source populations in the organic potato crops did not differ significantly. Analysis of the region gradient revealed genotype-specific disease gradients. Control measures are recommended.	Zwankhuizen, Maarten J.; Lab. Phytopathol., Wageningen Agric. Univ., P.O.

Conventional control of whitefly infestations has proven to be difficult and therefore we aim towards the development of whitefly resistance in crop species. By studying the plant-insect interaction we aim to establish the preference behavior of B. tabaci on certain crop species. It is known that within the species there is considerable genetic variation between populations. Within the scope of this project we set out to characterize a large set of whitefly populations from all over the world taken from different crops. B. tabaci was collected from several relevant locations (research stations of seed companies in the production areas of Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, India, Brazil, Mexico, Israel, Turkey and Spain) and from different crop species (tomato, melon, pepper, squash, eggplant, oilseed rape). The amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique was used to investigate the extent and nature of intraspecific variability of 35 different samples and to determine whether these populations comprise of multiple biotypes. Also, we established whether B. tabaci samples collected in the production areas differ from our lab culture, which originates from the Research station for Floriculture in Aalsmeer (The Netherlands).

J		Article		Hazard analysis of exotic pathogens of potential threat to European freshwater crayfish.		Edgerton, B. F. (brettedgerton@hotmail.com)									Bulletin Francais de la Peche et de la Pisciculture		2002	Decembre 2002		367	813-820	813	820	English	print					Managers, scientists, fishermen and farmers who work with freshwater crayfish understand clearly the severe affects that the introduction of an exotic pathogen can have on freshwater crayfish populations. This acute awareness is due to the severe impact on native European freshwater crayfish of the introduction of crayfish plague fungus Aphanomyces astaci. This issue has been thoroughly covered in previous reviews. The potential impact of other pathogens on European freshwater crayfish has not been addressed. This paper presents a hazard analysis of pathogens of freshwater crayfish exotic to Europe, which is the first step of import risk analysis.	Edgerton, B.

Histologically, Cryptococcus was found in multiple organs (brain and spinal cord, lungs, lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, liver, kidneys and adrenal glands). The lungs and CNS were the organs most often involved. Only in two cases was the diagnosis of cryptococcal infection established during the patient's lifetime, in both presenting clinically as meningitis, with positive result of CSF cultivation. Data and issues of diagnostics and treatment of cryptococcosis are discussed.

J		Article	Literature Review	Impacts of agricultural herbicide use on terrestrial wildlife in temperate landscapes: A review with special reference to North America		Freemark, Kathryn; Boutin, Celine									Agriculture Ecosystems and Environment		1995		52	2-3	67-91	67	91	English						The existing literature was examined to assess the extent to which wildlife (plants, soil organisms, above-ground insects/arthropods, mammals, birds) living in terrestrial habitats has been affected by use of agricultural herbicides in temperate landscapes. Although North America was of special interest for regulatory reasons, the review was extended to western Europe because the most extensive and intensive work has been done there. The half-life of herbicides in the environment ranges from less than 1 month to more than 1 year. Wildlife within fields is most likely to be exposed to herbicides, particularly when fields are planted with crops (e.g. corn, soybean, wheat, cotton) which are routinely sprayed. Wildlife is also likely to be exposed in non-crop habitats adjoining croplands, primarily from direct overspray (especially during aerial application), and drift during and/or volatilisation after application. The most conclusive scientific evidence for direct effects of herbicides on arable weeds, and associated indirect effects on insects and birds exists in the United Kingdom. Evidence for similar effects in North America is primarily circumstantial at present. Little work has been done anywhere on impacts of herbicides on plants and their associated fauna in non-crop habitats adjoining treated fields. Chemical farming (in particular, the use of herbicides) has dramatically altered the habitat pattern of temperate landscapes in North America and western Europe. Strong evidence exists for adverse effects of changes in habitat pattern on beneficial insects and arthropods in the United Kingdom, and on birds in North America and western Europe. Toxicity testing guidelines for nontarget plant protection need to be developed and enforced to support pesticide registration. In addition, research is needed to include more ecologically relevant plant species in laboratory tests, to develop multi-species tests (particularly in the field), to improve methods for risk assessment, and to develop options for mitigating risks. Large scale, long-term trans-disciplinary research of different farming systems is needed. particularly in North America, to integrate and better evaluate ecological, agronomic, and socioeconomic costs and benefits of agricultural herbicide use in temperate landscapes.

Plant Pathology (Oxford)		2007	AUG 2007	56	4	562-572	562	572	English						Genetic variation and pathogenicity of Pbytophthora infestans isolates collected from organic potato crops of the susceptible cv. Bintje and the moderately resistant cv. Sante were assessed in France, Norway, and the United Kingdom in 2001 and in Switzerland in 2001 and 2002. Population structures differed considerably between the four P. infestans populations. Those from France, Switzerland and the UK were mainly clonal populations showing restricted levels of genetic diversity, whilst those from Norway were mixed A1 and A2 mating type populations with high levels of genetic diversity, suggesting periodical sexual reproduction. Isolates collected from cv. Bintje were on average more aggressive than or comparable to isolates from cv. Sante. Race complexity varied considerably between the regional P. infestans populations, with isolates from France and Switzerland showing the highest number of virulence factors. In all pathogen samples but the French, isolates collected from cv. Sante were more complex than isolates collected from cv. Bintje. No directional selection towards increased aggressiveness towards the more resistant cultivar Sante was observed. This suggests that there is no shift towards increased levels of pathogenicity in P. infestans populations following the large-scale introduction of more resistant potato varieties in organic production systems in Europe.

Biological Conservation		2008	NOV 2008	141	11	2765-2783	2765	2783	English						The Ramsar site of Lake Uluabat, western Turkey, suffers from eutrophication, urban and industrial pollution and water abstraction, and its water levels are managed artificially. Here we combine monitoring and palaeolimnological. techniques to investigate spatial and temporal limnological variability and ecosystem impact, using an ostracod and mollusc survey to strengthen interpretation of the fossil record. A combination of low invertebrate Biological Monitoring Working Party scores (<10) and the dominance of eutrophic diatoms in the modern lake confirms its poor ecological status. Palaeolimnological analysis of recent (last >200 yr) changes in organic and carbonate content, diatoms, stable isotopes, ostracods and molluscs in a lake sediment core (UL20A) indicates a 20th century trend towards increased sediment accumulation rates and eutrophication which was probably initiated by deforestation and agriculture. The most marked ecological shift occurs in the early 1960s, however. A subtle rise in diatom-inferred total phosphorus and an inferred reduction in submerged aquatic macrophyte cover accompanies a major increase in sediment accumulation rate. An associated marked shift in ostracod stable isotope data indicative of reduced seasonality and a change in hydrological input suggests major impact from artificial water management practices, all of which appears to have culminated in the sustained loss of submerged macrophytes since 2000. The study indicates it is vital to take both land-use and water management practices into account in devising restoration strategies. in a wider context, the results have important implications for the conservation of shallow karstic lakes, the functioning of which is still poorly understood.

B		Book Chapter Meeting		Udder health, treatments and pathogens in organic dairy herds in the Netherlands		Smolders, E. A. A.; van der Werf, J.; van de Mortel, D.; Kijlstra, A.			Hogeveen, H						Mastitis in Dairy Production:CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND FUTURE SOLUTIONS		2005				248-253	248	253	English		4th IDF International Mastitis Conference	Maastricht, NETHERLANDS	June 12 -15, 2005	Int Dairy Federat; Netherlands Natl Comm	83 organic dairy farmers in the Netherlands were questioned about management and risk factors for poor udder health, treatment of mastitis and their strategies for good udder health. Milk recording data, including cow somatic cell count (SCC), and bulk tank milk cell count (BMSCC) from 2001 until 2003 were collected. All quarters of high cell count cows (> 250,000 cells/ml; heifers>150,000) were sampled for SCC and pathogens. The aim of the study was to determine the range of problems in udder health and to investigate management and treatment strategies practiced by farmers to maintain good udder health in organic dairy herds.Sub clinical mastitis is a frequent occurring health problem in organic dairy herds in the Netherlands. The percentage of cows with high SCC ranged between 10 - 52. Eighty percent of the farmers used antibiotics against clinical mastitis as the only treatment or in combination with other treatments such as frequent milking, homeopathy and massage with peppermint oil. Homeopathy was used on more than 50% of the farms but only 10% of the farmers used it without antibiotics. The percentage of high cell count cows on farms using antibiotics to treat clinical mastitis ranged between 10 - 46; on farms not using antibiotics in treating clinical mastitis this figure ranged between 12 - 52%. Some farmers succeed in maintaining good udder health with preventive measures without the use of antibiotics. Ten percent of BMSCC were above the Dutch penalty Limit of 400.000 cells/ml milk. Streptococcus uberis (19.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (16.1%) and Staphylococcus not aureus (45.1%) were the most common pathogens in the culture positive samples of high SCC cows. Types of pathogens in organic milk samples did not significantly differ from those in conventional milk samples.	Smolders, E. A.

J		Article		Flora and vegetation at Neuendorfer See lake and vicinity (Spreewald biospheric reservation, Germany)		Kummer, Volker									Verhandlungen des Botanischen Vereins von Berlin und Brandenburg		1998		Supplement 4		1-208	1	208	German	print					The flora and vegetation of the Lake "Neuendorfer See" and its close vicinity in the northern part of the lower Spreewald was studied during 1992 and 1995; some additional data were taken in 1996 and 1997. A total of 698 non-cultivated species of ferns and flowering plants were recorded in the investigation area. The percentage representation of native taxa is 71,5 %. According to the Red Data Book of Brandenburg the percentage representation of endangered species is 13,4 % while 13 taxa are regarded as extinct or missing for the region. Therefore the area plays an important role in plant conservation especially of water plants (altogether 15 Potamogeton species were found). A list of the mosses and lichens recorded in the investigation area and their degree of threat is also given as well as a list of fungi, the latter is presented only as a survey. The vegetation was phytosociologically analysed. Excluding pine afforestations a total of 83 vegetation units were described. 29 of the vegetation units are endangered supra-regionally (Central and Northeastern Germany) and 35 in the region of Lower Lusatia (Niederlausitz). Although aquatic vegetation has declined in the last 25 years, there is at least partially still an astounding variety. The reed communities and grasslands are highly diverse (29 vegetation units). Together with the water plant communities they constitute the biotopes of many endangered species. However, some of them are affected by ruderalisation due to a decline of cultivation and eutrophication. Especially the reed vegetation at the lake shores was severely reduced in the last 30 years. Further vegetation units described in this account belong to from arid grasslands, ruderal herb associations, crop fields and deciduous woodland. The botanically important areas are shown and some suggestions for their conservation are given.	Kummer, Volker; Universitaet Potsdam, Institut f. Systematik u. Didaktik d.

J	8730928	Article		Dinophysistoxin-2: The predominant diarrhoetic shellfish toxin in Ireland		Carmody, Eoin P.; James, Kevin J.; Kelly, Sean S.									Toxicon		1996		34	3	351-359	351	359	English						Diarrhoetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) in Europe is due mainly to the presence of the dinoflagellate toxin, okadaic acid (OA). However, analysis of cultivated mussels (Mytilus edulis) from southwest Ireland revealed that an isomer of OA, dinophysistoxin-2, was the major toxin present during DSP episodes. Using fluorimetric HPLC, following derivatisation with 9-anthryldiazomethane, both OA and DTX-2 were found in shellfish during a prolonged toxic episode in 1991. However, examination of similar mussel cultivation locations In 1994 showed that DTX-2 was even more predominant. During this DSP period, OA levels were less than 0.7 mu-g/g, whereas maximum DTX-2 levels of 6.3 mu-g/g hepatopancreas were recorded. This toxicity in shellfish occurred soon after high cell counts of Dinophysis acuta were observed. As well as large seasonal variability in toxin levels in rope cultured mussels, substantial variations were also observed, both horizontally and vertically, within the water column.

J	10760403	Article		Udder health and risk factors for subclinical mastitis in organic dairy farms in Switzerland		Busato, A.; Trachsel, P.; Schallibaum, M.; Blum, J. W.									Preventive Veterinary Medicine		2000	April 28, 2000	44	3-4	205-220	205	220	English	print					A study was performed in 1997 to estimate the prevalence and to investigate the etiology of subclinical mastitis in Swiss dairy herds managed under guidelines of controlled organic farming. It was planned as a longitudinal study over a period of 1 year and included a stratified random sample of 152 certified organic farms and 1907 cows. Two farm visits (the first from June to October when cows were on pasture, the second from January to March when cows were confined to barns) were performed on each farm. At each visit, farm management and individual-cow data (with emphasis on milking procedures and udder sanitation) were recorded. California mastitis tests (CMTs) were performed on each udder quarter of all cows in lactation. Milk samples with CMT >1+ were submitted for somatic cell counting (SCC), bacteriological examination and to test for antibiotic susceptibility. The SCC and germ-cell counts of monthly bulk-tank milk samples were available through Dairy Inspection and Advisory Services and milk production data of 567 herd-book cows were available from breeding associations. Possible individual and environmental predictors of subclinical mastitis were identified using logistic models adjusted for clustering of the data at herd and cow levels. Data were analyzed separately for cows from 7 to 100 and from 101 to 305 days post partum. Prevalences of subclinical mastitis at the quarter level were 21.2% for lactation period 7-100 days and 34.5% for 101-305 days post partum. The geometric mean SCC in bulk-tank milk samples was 85.6 X 103 cells/ml. Samples at 7-100 and 101-305 days post partum were positive for Staphylococcus aureus in 16.0 and 7.4%, for coagulase-negative Staphylococci in 51.5 and 50.6%, for Streptococcus agalactiae in 0.0 and 0.8%, for other Streptococci in 19.4 and 15.6%, for E. coli in 1.0 and 0.4%, and for Corynebacterium bovis in 25.7 and 45.1%, respectively. Risks of subclinical mastitis increased significantly with increasing days post partum and advancing age of cow. Cows that were sampled when staying in alpine dairies had considerably higher risks of subclinical mastitis than cows staying in home barns. Significantly lower risks of subclinical mastitis were observed in farms where CMT was performed regularly as a control measure. Bacteria in milk from cows with mastitis exhibited antibiotic resistance at a comparable frequency as found previously in conventional farms.	Blum, J.

Waste Management		2007		27	9	1117-1128	1117	1128	English						In Ireland, conversion of biodegradable farm wastes such as pig manure spent mushroom compost and poultry litter wastes to pelletised fertilisers is a desirable option for farmers. In this paper, results obtained from the composting of pig waste solids (20% w/w) blended with other locally available biodegradable wastes comprising poultry litter (26% w/w), spent mushroom compost (26% w/w), cocoa husks (18% w/w) and moistened shredded paper (10%, w/w) are presented. The resulting 6-mo old 'mature' composts had a nutrient content of 2.3% total N, 1.6% P and 3.1% K, too 'low' for direct use as an agricultural fertiliser. Formulations incorporating dried blood or feather meal amendments enriched the organic N-content, reduced the moisture in mature compost mixtures and aided the granulation process. Inclusion of mineral supplements viz., sulphate of ammonia, rock phosphate and sulphate of potash, yielded slow release fertilisers with nutrient N:P:K ratios of 10:3:6 and 3:5:10 that were suited for amenity grasslands such as golf courses for spring or summer application and autumn dressing, respectively. Rigorous microbiological tests carried out throughout the composting, processing and pelletising phases indicated that the formulated organo-mineral fertilisers were free of vegetative bacterial pathogens.

Aquaculture International		2005	JAN 2005	13	1-2	167-173	167	173	English						The mussel and fish- farming impact was investigated both in pelagic and sediment environments of Mar Piccolo in Taranto. We studied the yearly distribution of microbiological indicators ( heterotrophic bacteria and coliforms), in relation to physical and chemical parameters of surface water at three different sites, characterized by mussel farms, fish cages and Citro springs. The heterotrophic bacteria and Clostridium perfrigens distribution were also examined in relation to organic content and granulometry of sediments. The urban sewages affected the quality of waters of the mussel site, by increasing faecal coliforms in the entire basin during summer. In the benthonic environment the aquaculture activity increased the bio-deposition of the sediment, causing changes in the abundance and the composition ( heterotrophic bacteria/clostridia ratio) of micro. ora. A significant increase of heterotrophic bacteria in the warm season was observed. The clostridia proved to be a good indicator of impact of organic matter because they were significantly higher in the sites than the control stations.

Microbial Ecology		2008	NOV 2008	56	4	720-732	720	732	English						The effects of organic and integrated production systems on the culturable fungal microflora of stored apple fruits from five matched pairs of certified organic and integrated 'Golden Delicious' farms were studied at five representative production sites in Switzerland. Isolated fungi were identified morphologically. Colonization frequency (percentage of apples colonized), abundance (colony numbers), and diversity (taxon richness) were assessed for each orchard. The standard quality of the stored fruits was comparable for both organic and integrated apples and complied with national food hygiene standards. Yeasts (six taxa) and the yeast-like fungus Aureobasidium pullulans were the dominant epiphytes, filamentous fungi (21 taxa) the dominant endophytes. The most common fungi occurred at all sites and belonged to the "white" and "pink" yeasts, yeast-like A. pullulans, filamentous fungi Cladosporium spp., Alternaria spp., and sterile filamentous fungi. Canonical correspondence analysis of the total fungal community revealed a clear differentiation among production systems and sites. Compared to integrated apples, organic apples had significantly higher frequencies of filamentous fungi, abundance of total fungi, and taxon diversity. The effects of the production system on the fungal microflora are most likely due to the different plant protection strategies. The incidence of potential mycotoxin producers such as Penicillium and Alternaria species was not different between production systems. We suggest that higher fungal diversity may generally be associated with organic production and may increase the level of beneficial and antagonistically acting species known for their potential to suppress apple pathogens, which may be an advantage to organic apples, e.g., in respect to natural disease control.

The identification was made by conventional phenotypic characteristics and biochemical tests. Among isolates from the probiotic products antibiotic susceptibility was detected using the E-test (ABBiodisk). Our results demonstrate that nine food supplements and two fermented foods claimed species which could not be isolated, whereas potential pathogens (i.e. Micromonas micros) were isolated. Lactobacilli displayed species-dependent antibiotic resistance. Atypical resistance occurred for penicillin in Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus and for erythromycin in Lactobacillus lactis and Lactobacillus salivarius. A broad range of MICs was observed for cephalosporins and fluroquinolones. Aminoglycosides had poor activity against Lactobacillus isolates. Two of the four isolates of Bifidobacterium exhibited high resistance to trimethroprim/sulfametoxazole and to fluoroquinolones.Our results suggest that some probiotic products claim species that cannot always be isolated, and are sometimes contaminated by potential pathogens. Moreover, the probable transferable erythromycin or penicillin resistance among the lactobacilli isolated should be taken into account.

Cryptogamie Mycologie		1995		16	2	111-119	111	119	English						Greek tannery wastes are relatively rich in organic materials, with mimosa condensed tannins being predominant (6% w/v). In spite of the tannin toxicity for the microorganisms, the microbial flora of tannery liquid wastes is relatively rich, with the Aspergillus niger group predominant. Sixteen fungal species belonging to six genera and two yeasts belonging to one genus were isolated. Most of the isolates are adapted to tanninous environments. All isolated species were grown in tannery liquid wastes; 61% of the isolates reduced the tannin content of the waste more than 50%. Aspergillus carbonarius presented the highest tannin reduction (78%). The cultivation of the best isolates in tannery liquid wastes gave a biomass rich in protein and a safe culture filtrate, seeing that the initial BOD (3000 mg/l) was reduced to 70 mg/l.	Univ.

(hda1@cam.ac.uk)									Land Degradation & Development		2003	May-June 2003	14	3	265-283	265	283	English	print					Palaeoecological analysis of a 3 m sediment core from a coastal site in the western Algarve, near Lagos, Portugal, reveals the changing ecological characteristics of the wetland environment during the late Holocene. The dinoflagellate record and sedimentary characteristics show that approximately 2000 years ago the modern Boca do Rio wetlands were an estuary. By about 1200 14C years BP, transition to a lower energy environment was taking place. The pollen record at this time indicates the existence of typical salt marsh vegetation. There is a likely hiatus in the sedimentary record caused by the tsunami associated with the Lisbon earthquake of AD 1755. A barrier lake, impounded by tsunami deposits, existed for approximately 60 years before being breached, followed by a reoccurrence of saline conditions. A comparison of the mineral magnetic signature of the sediments with that of soil samples from the catchment suggests a relatively local provenance for some of the sediments, rather than the highly erodible Carboniferous rocks of the Algarve's Serra uplands. However, it is also suggested that there is a biogenic component to the magnetic mineralogy. Coastal wetlands among the most vulnerable Mediterranean environments. The history and future of the Boca do Rio wetlands is examined in the context of alluviation history, rising sea levels, both past and future, and catchment land use. Changing patterns of cultivation, irrigation and land abandonment during the last 50 years are likely to have increased water demands within the catchment and therefore decreased river discharge to the wetlands. Consequently, the continued existence of the wetlands in their present form is in doubt, despite being part of a protected natural park.	Allen, H.

Bioprocess and Biosystems Engineering		2005	DEC 2005	28	3	139-148	139	148	English						Anaerobic digestion would enable the energy potential of agricultural crop residues such as sugar beet tops and straw to be harnessed. Sweden is so spread out that full utilisation of this potential by centralised slurry-based technology is difficult. It appears that simple but effective high-solids reactor systems have a better chance of being economically viable on a farm-scale level (50500 kW). In the present study, the financial prospects of high-solids digestion, using either single-stage fed-batch or two-stage batch reactor systems, are compared on a farm-scale level (50 kW) with those of conventional slurry digestion, on the basis of experimental results and observations on a laboratory- and pilot-scale. The gas produced can be used for heat, combined heat and power or as vehicle fuel. The results indicate high-solids single-stage fed-batch operations to stand the best chances of being competitive, particularly in connection with organic farming. The methane yield, degree of gas utilisation, and operational costs were found to have the strongest impact on the financial success of the process.	Svensson, L.

Journal of Veterinary Medicine Series B		2002	May, 2002	49	4	176-180	176	180	English	print					In order to evaluate the prevalence of Isospora suis in conventional piglet production in Germany, pooled faecal samples from 327 pig litters from 18 pig production units (20-320 sows each) were examined. At least 10 litters from each farm were investigated. I. suis was present on 83% of the farms and 42.5% of the litters, the infection rate being highest in the third week of age (48.2%). I. suis was found more frequently in samples of diarrhoea than in firm faeces (49.2% compared to 22.2%). Twenty naturally infected piglets from six of these farms underwent examination post mortem, including histology, virology and bacteriology. Histological examination revealed atrophy of the villi in various degrees, mild crypt hyperplasia, fusion of the villi, metaplastic epithelium, erosions and necrosis, especially in the medium and the posterior jejunum and in the ileum. Asexual and sexual developmental stages of the parasite were found in varying numbers in the epithelium of the whole of the small intestine. Bacteria and viruses were mostly excluded as the cause of diarrhoea, and it was concluded that I. suis was the primary pathogen inducing distinct changes and clinical symptoms of diarrhoea.

J		Article	Literature Review	Ecology of the entomopathogenic fungi Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae in temperate agroecosystems: Potential for conservation biological control		Meyling, Nicolai V. (nvm@life.ku.dk) ; Eilenberg, Jorgen									Biological Control		2007	NOV 2007	43	2	145-155	145	155	English						It is increasingly recognized that the biodiversity in agroecosystems deliver significant ecosystem services to agricultural production such as biological control of pests. Entomopathogenic fungi, specifically the anamorphic taxa Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae, Hypocreales (Ascomycota), are among the natural enemies of pests in agroecosystems and the fungi are candidates for future conservation biological control in temperate regions. Conservation biological control is a biological control strategy in which farming practices and environmental manipulations are adopted to enhance the living conditions for specific natural enemies of pests. However, in order to manipulate the environment for the benefit of populations of the entomopathogens, knowledge of fundamental aspects of the ecology of the fungi considered is necessary. This knowledge is still scarce despite the large bulk of recent research into inoculation and inundation biological control with these fungi. Here, we review the current knowledge of the ecology of indigenous populations of B. bassiana and M. anisopliae in agroecosystems of temperate regions, primarily Europe and North America. We suggest anamorphic life cycles of B. bassiana and M anisopliae in these regions based on the literature of their natural occurrence and distribution in agroecosystems, population dynamics, and interactions with other organisms, environmental factors, and agronomical practices.

To this end a stratified sampling was carried out taking as a criterion the size of the population in a given area of residence. Residents in sparsely populated areas were found to have a prevalence of 38.5%, significantly greater than in highly populated areas (odds ratio (OR) = 1.56; 95% confidence interval (CI) : 1.08-2.27 and OR = 1.58: 95% CI : 1.09-2.30). The prevalence was significantly higher in males (36.3%) than in females (29%), and was found to increase significantly with age. Current or previous participation in activities relating to agriculture and/or livestock farming or even having contact with cattle, goats or sheep were also found to be risk factors for the infection. A fuller study of the determinants of chronic Q fever should be initiated.	Sanzo, J.

J		Article		Saline lakes: Integrating ecology into their management future		Comin, F. A.; Cabrera, M.; Rodo, X.									Hydrobiologia		1999	Feb., 1999	395-396	0	241-251	241	251	English	print					Defining the key temporal scales of variability in ecological processes is fundamental to saline lake management because the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of saline lakes undergo fluctuations at different time scales, compared to those of freshwater lakes. A long-term study of Lake Gallocanta (25 km2 area inland saline lake in NE Spain) provides the ecological basis for its management. The coupling of the administrative framework with its ecological processes is examined. Limnological and climatological parameters were measured using standard methods during 1977-1995. Complete desiccation of the lake occurred in 1983-86 and in 1994-95. Water level fluctuations were strongly correlated with meteorological events, particularly rainfall for seasonal and decadal time scales. The relationship between salinity and water volume follows the typical model described for playa lakes. However, the intensity and frequency of the salinity and water volume fluctuations in Lake Gallocanta also change over time. Most species show pulsing population dynamics at the larger time scales (annual, decadal). However, many of these show a continuous population development at shorter time scales. Examples are provided for several phytoplankton and zooplankton species. Fluctuations in water level also influence phyto and zooplankton community structure. The combination of the number of species, S, and the number of individuals, N, as K=log S/log N indicates that the community structure also fluctuates at different time scales. Most of the present laws established for the management of saline lakes are centered on the conservation of waterfowl. Although some generic laws attempt to preserve the overall natural ecosystem, only those dealing with the protection of wild flora and fauna, and threatened species, are implemented. However, ecological knowledge now suggests that the major objective for the conservation of saline lakes should be to preserve the fluctuation of the hydrological balance, avoiding groundwater extraction in the catchment area and surface water. Generic laws regulate water use in Spain and in many other countries. These laws are not useful for saline lake management because they do not offer solutions to the frequent conflicts arising between the water demand for intensive agriculture and nature conservation, which are common in the semi-arid zones where saline lakes are located. Integrated management of the land and water resources in the catchment area is required to preserve saline lake characteistics. Recent legislation aims to promote such management. A model of conservation and development of the overall ecosystem is presented.	Comin, F.

Applied and Environmental Microbiology		2005	JUN 2005	71	6	2840-2847	2840	2847	English						The diversity and genetic interrelation of Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli isolated from Swiss poultry were assessed by three independent typing methods. Samples were derived prior to slaughter from 100 randomly selected flocks (five birds per Hock) raised on three different farm types. The observed flock prevalence was 54 % in total, with 50 % for conventional and 69 % for free-range farms. Birds held on farms with a confined roaming area had the lowest prevalence of 37 %. Campylobacter isolates were characterized by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), restriction fragment length polymorphism of flaA PCR fragments (flaA-RFLP), and disk diffusion testing for eight antimicrobial agents that are commonly used in veterinary or human medicine in Switzerland. Analysis of the genotypic results indicates that the Campylobacter population in Swiss poultry is genetically highly diverse. Nevertheless, occasionally, isolates with identical or nearly identical characteristics were isolated from different farms or farm types in different locations. Genetic typing by AFLP and flaA-RFLP was found to be complementary. The majority of isolates (67 %) were susceptible to all tested antibiotics; however, single, double, and triple resistances were observed in 7 %, 23 %, and 2 % of the strains, respectively. There was no correlation between genotype and antibiotic resistance. Surprisingly, sulfonamide resistance was frequently found together with streptomycin resistance. Our findings illustrate the results of common genetic exchange in the studied bacterial population.	Wassenaar, T.

Data on outpatient prescriptions were obtained from the database of General Health Insurance Company and expressed in defined daily doses per 1000 clients per day (DID). Escherichia coli strains were isolated from samples of urine of both community and hospitalized patients suffering from acute bacterial urinary tract infection, examined using aerobic cultivation, and determined by standard biochemical procedures.Results The utilization of fluoroquinolones in inpatients has significantly (p < 0.01) increased from 2.52 DBD in 1997 to 4.29 DBD in 2002. In outpatients, fluoroquinolone utilization has also increased significantly from 0.14 to 0.95 DID (p < 0.01). In the same period, 9192 E. coli strains were isolated from inpatients and outpatients suffering by urinary tract infections and tested for the susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. Resistance increased significantly (p < 0.01) both in the hospital (from 2 to 9%) and in the community (from 1 to 10%). The development of E. coli resistance to fluoroquinolones correlates significantly with their utilization both in the hospital (r = 0.944, p = 0.005) and in the community (r = 0.859, p = 0.029).Conclusions Results of this study shows the impact of fluoroquinolone utilization on E. coli resistance and support the need of controlled use of these effective antibiotics.

J		Article		Soil algae in two farming systems of potato cropping.		Sieminiak, Dorota									Bulletin of the Polish Academy of Sciences Biological Sciences		2003		51	1	1-8	1	8	English	print					The two-year-long studies on a community of green and yellow-green algae accompanied by common cyanophytes and diatoms were carried out in grey brown podsolic soils (Hapludalfs) under both the organic and integrated crop production systems. Standing crops of algae (0.04-0.21 kg2cntdotha-1) on soil surface and in an arable layer (5.49-16.31 kgcntdotha-1) were evaluated. Algal biomass in the plots of integrated farming was statistically higher than in the organically growth, at the significance level <0.05 for soil surface, and at the significance level <0.001 for the arable layer, in both years. The organic cropping had a more diverse diatom flora, the increased amount of heterocystous blue-green algae such as Nostoc punctiforme (Kutz.) Hariot, N. paludosum Kutz., and was characterised by Cylindrospermum licheniforme (Bory) Kutz., C. majus Kutz., Schmidleinema danilovii Hollerbach, and Vaucheria hamata Walz occur.

Here, we investigated soils under grassland and forest close to the North Sea that began its genesis under terrestrial conditions 30 years ago after dikes were closed. Organic C contents of up to 99 mg g(-1) soil were found until 6 cm soil depth. The humus consisted mainly of the fraction lighter than 1.6 g cm(-3) which refers to poorly degraded organic carbon. High microbial respiratory activity was determined with values between 1.57 and 1.17 mu g CO2-C g(-1) soil h(-1) at 22 degrees C and 40 to 70% waterholding capacity for the grassland and forest topsoils, respectively. The microbial C to organic C ratio showed values up to 20 mg C-mic g(-1) C-org. Although up to 2.69 kg C m(-2) were estimated to be sequestered during 30 years, the microbial indicators showed intensive colonisation and high transformation rates under both forest and grassland which were higher than those determined in agricultural and forest topsoils in Northern Germany.

The result indicates that under pure cultivation, the strains tested showed the typical morphological characteristics of Frankia, some of them may have specialized torulose hyphe. All Frankia strains tested showed presence of the meso-DAP and whole-cell sugar pattern D. All of them showed a marked increase in nitrogenase activity from 24-72 h after the addition of acetylene, and the maximum nitrogenase activity can be achieved at 48 h or 72 h. Physiological result were assessed in order to compare 35 Frankia strains tested, based on the different utilization of carbohydrates at a 0.5% (W/V) concentration and organic acid salts as a 0.2% (W/V) concentration, the strains isolated from 8 genes of angiospermous plant hosts can be classified into 2 groups (including 4 subgroups).

J	12425046	Article		Pest insect control in organically-produced crops of field vegetables		Collier, Rosemary H.; Finch, Stan; Davies, Gareth									Mededelingen Faculteit Landbouwkundige en Toegepaste Biologische Wetenschappen Universiteit Gent		2001		66	2A	259-267	259	267	English	print					In the UK, the demand for organic vegetable and salad crops is increasing, mainly as a result of the requirements of the multiple retailers. However, approximately 85% of the organic fruit and vegetable produce sold in the UK is imported. A major constraint to growing field vegetable crops, and particularly organically-produced crops, is the reduction in crop yield and quality caused by pest insects. This paper will consider the control techniques currently available to organic growers and other techniques that may become available in the future. Growing plant varieties with complete or even partial resistance to pest insects can be an effective way of reducing crop damage. There are already varieties of carrot, with resistance to carrot fly, and lettuce, with resistance to certain pest aphid species, which are available commercially. Cultural techniques to exclude, deter or avoid pest insects are also being used by some organic growers. Although isolating new crops from sources of infestation can be a highly effective control strategy, many organic growers cannot use it, as the land converted for organic production is still limited. Various crop covers can be used to prevent pest insects from damaging field crops, but to be effective such covers have to be in place before the pests enter the crop. Several researchers have tried to develop techniques to prevent pest insects from finding their host-plants. No technique involving semiochemicals has been sufficiently successful to be used in field vegetable production in the UK. Other studies have shown that the numbers of pest insects found on crop plants are reduced considerably when the crop is allowed to become weedy, is intercropped with another plant species, or is undersown with a living mulch. Hence, work is now needed to select background plant species that will both reduce pest insect numbers and cause the least reduction in yield to the harvested crop plants. There is also a need to obtain a better understanding of "companion planting", a practice used frequently by organic growers. To date, microbial control is the only biological technique that has been used successfully in field vegetable crops in the UK. However, only the toxicant produced by one microbial agent, the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis, has so far been registered for use. The use of bacteria, fungi and viruses to control pests of field vegetable crops certainly has possibilities. However, in many cases there are still problems to be overcome to select pathogens that are compatible with, or can still be effective in, the wide fluctuations in temperature, humidity and soil moisture that occur under field conditions. Attempts are now being made to use entomopathogenic nematodes and predatory arthropods to control one major pest insect, the cabbage root fly. Techniques developed to improve the timing of application of various crop protection procedures in systems of conventional vegetable production apply equally well to organic production, despite the choice of control options being more limited. In particular, models to forecast the timing of pest insect attacks could be used to great effect, to indicate the best times to plant, protect and harvest a specific crop to minimise pest insect damage.

J	17905736	Article		Determinants of microbial exposure in grain farming		Halstensen, A. S. (anne.s.halstensen@stami.no) ; Nordby, K. C.; Wouters, I. M.; Eduard, W.									Annals of Occupational Hygiene		2007	OCT 2007	51	7	581-592	581	592	English						Objectives: Exposure to organic dust containing high concentrations of microorganisms is common in grain farming, although the farmers have practices to counteract microbial growth to obtain optimal grain yields. We investigated the influence of weather and production practices on personal microbial exposure during grain work.Methods: Airborne dust was collected by personal sampling during threshing and storage work on 92 Norwegian farms. The personal exposure for bacteria, endotoxin, fungal spores and hyphae, beta-(1 -> 3)-glucans and actinomycetes was quantified and compared with climatic data expressed as fungal forecasts from the grain growth season and production practices as reported by farmers.Results: Farmers were exposed to a geometrical mean of 4.4 mg m(-3) inhalable dust [geometrical standard deviation (GSD) = 4.0], 4 x 10(-6) m(-3) bacteria and fungal spores (GSD = 5.2 and 5.9, respectively), 5.9 x 10(3) EU m(-3) of endotoxins (GSD = 8.6), 2 x 10(5) m(-3) actinomycetes (GSD = 15.3), 120 mu gm(-3) beta-(1 -> 3)-glucans (GSD = 4.7) and 5 x 10(5) AU m(-3) of hyphae (GSD = 4.4). Univariate associations were found between one or several of these microbial factors and work operation, visible fungal damage, grain species, lodging of grain, storage technology or harvester type. As assessed by general linear models, storage work was the main predictive determinant for microbial exposure, although grain species and visible fungal damage also were also important. Wet and warm weather throughout the grain growth season were associated with elevated exposure for inhalable dust, beta-(1 -> 3)-glucans, endotoxins and hyphae during threshing. The beta-(1 -> 3)-glucan exposure could biologically be explained by the fungal spore and hyphal exposure, both variables contributing equally. However, spores were most important during storage work, whereas only hyphae were predictive during threshing.Conclusions: Farmers were exposed to high levels of microorganisms and their components during dusty grain work. Dust prevention and protection may reduce microbial exposure, and may be particularly important in areas with frequent fungal forecasts, when fungal damage has been observed, during storage work or when handling barley.

Avian Diseases		2005	SEP 2005	49	3	390-396	390	396	English						Ten conventional and four extensive outdoor broiler flocks, distributed over nine farms, were investigated twice per week during a 35-58-day rearing period to observe the dynamics of Campylobacter spp. spread within these flocks. Strains isolated during this period were genotyped by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the M gene and macro restriction profiling with pulsed field gel electrophoresis. A total of 4112 samples were collected; 157 (3.8%) of these samples were Campylobacter positive, with all C jejuni. The positive samples were distributed over three conventional and two extensive outdoor flocks on five farms. These five positive flocks were colonized from the fifth to the seventh week of age and remained colonized until slaughter. Each of the flocks showed a flock-specific genotype of Campylobacter that predominated until slaughter. Presuming different ways of entry, a combination of this fact and the observed dynamics of C jejuni spread within the flocks indicates that a single source from the environment may have been responsible for the colonization of each flock. These conclusions may serve to further develop combat strategies at farm level.

The natural occurrence of patulin in four apple products marketed in Italy and purchased from the supermarket, herbalist, and retail shops was studied. Thirty-three samples of the four products had no detectable patulin contamination. The 11 positive samples had a concentration ranging between 1.4 and 74.2 mug/L with a mean of 26.7 mug/L. All vinegar samples were negative for patulin; of 10 apple-based baby foods, two samples were contaminated with 17.7 and 13.1 mug/L and both were labeled as "organic food". Comparing organic and conventional agricultural practices, no significant differences were found. Finally, optimization of extraction protocol more general and useful for juices, clarified juices, baby foods, vinegars, and purees was performed. The low incidence of the patulin level in Italian apple products is a clear parameter to judge the quality of the fruit, and the process is of a high standard.

In 16 slacks turf was stripped over a total area of ca 35 hectares, making this one of the largest restoration projects in Dutch coastal sand dunes. Since 1995 the greatest part of the area is grazed round the year by Highland Cattle and Exmoor ponies, in order to maintain a short vegetation with an open structure, suitable for stress-tolerant pionier-species. Two slacks are excluded from the grazing-regime and are mown annually in September. Monitoring of the flora in the stripped sites showed that 225 species settled in the first 5 years of colonisation. So far 30 species of the Dutch Red List have established themselves in the slacks (table 1). In the first years spectacular developments took place in the more or less permanent dune pools, where 7 species of Stonewort and 7 species op Pondweed, among which the rare Potamogeton coloratus (Bruin, 1997) were found. The wet or only moist parts of the slacks showed a slower development of flora and vegetation. The wetter parts harboured species like Echinodorus ranunculoides and Samolus valerandi, while higher up Salix repens, Juncus- and Carex-species were abundant, together with more rare species like Anagallis tenella and A. minima.

J		Article		Understanding the microbial ecosystem on the grape berry surface through numeration and identification of yeast and bacteria		Renouf, Vincent; Claisse, Olivier; Lonvaud-Funel, Aline (aline.lonvaud@oenologie.u-bordeaux2.fr)									Australian Journal of Grape and Wine Research		2005		11	3	316-327	316	327	English						Microbial species present on the surface of grape berries at harvest play an important role in winemaking, thus counting and identifying them is of great importance. The use of conventional microbial techniques and molecular methods allowed a quantitative and qualitative inventory of the different microbial species present on the grape berries. These experiments were carried out in several areas of the Bordeaux region on the red grape varieties Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Populations and species clearly varied according to berry development stage. The most widespread yeast species at berry set, Aureobasidium pullulans was never detected at harvest. Fermentative yeasts were detected at harvest and not in the first stage of grape growth. Oenoccocus oeni was detected on immature as well as on mature berries. Gluconobacter oxydans was detected mainly at harvest. Detection of Pediococcus parvulus, was dependent on the vineyard. Veraison appeared to be a key stage for yeast colonisation and the increase in population involved a change in the proportion of each species. The number of A. pullulans fell significantly at veraison as it was superseded by fermentative yeasts. Microbial populations peaked at harvest when the berry surface available for adhesion was largest and no agrochemical treatments had been applied for some weeks. Soil, grape variety and grapegrowing practices may also influence this microbial ecosystem. Based on these and published data, we formulated hypotheses to describe this microbial ecosystem, thus enabling us to develop the concept of a microbial biofilm.

J		Article		Microbiological indicators of the Nisava River water quality		Petrovic, Olga; Nenin, Predrag; Radnovic, Dragan									Mikrobiologija (Zemun)		1996		33	1	53-62	53	62	English						This paper presents the results of microbiological investigation of the Nisava river water performed on the basis of standard microbiological methods involving direct counting on membrane filters and cultivation techniques. Samples were taken at four sampling sites along the Sicevo Gorge. Total bacteria count, number of heterotrophs and facultative oligotrophs and the presence of the representatives of a number of physiological groups, such as proteolytic, lipolytic, saccharolytic, phenol- and oil-oxidizing, nitrifying, denitrifying and ammonia-producing bacteria, were determined. Moreover, the total phosphatase activity of the examined water was also measured. For the purpose of water quality assessment, in addition to the above mentioned, the following microbiological indicators were also used: categorization according to Kohl (Kohl, 1975), phosphatase activity index (PAI), total bacteria count to heterotrophs count ratio (T/H index), and number of oligotrophs to heterotrophs ratio (O/H index). The results obtained showed that the Nisava river water mostly belongs to III-IV or IV class, which indicating an organic water load of a heterogeneous origin. According to the investigated microbiological indicators, the poorest water quality was recorded for the sample from site 4, located downstream from the factory waste water effluent. Nevertheless, the determined O/H index points out to a still satisfying water self-purification capacity.	Inst. Biol., Fac. Nat. Sci., Univ.

J	16628890	Article		Field studies to determine mancozeb based spray programmes with minimal impact on predatory mites in European vine cultivation		Miles, M.; Kemmitt, G.									Communications in Agricultural and Applied Biological Sciences		2005		70	4	559-567	559	567	English						Mancozeb is an ethylene bisdithiocarbamate (EBDC) fungicide with contact activity against a wide range of economically important fungal diseases. Its multi-site mode of action means that to date there have been no recorded incidences of resistance developing despite many years of use on high risk diseases. One such disease, Grape downy mildew (Plasmopara viticola) has developed resistance to a number of important oomycete specific fungicides following their introduction onto the market. The role of Mancozeb either as a mixing or alternation partner in helping to manage these resistance situations remains critically important. Historical use patterns for mancozeb in tree and vine crops involved many applications of product at high use rates. Although this gave excellent disease control, a negative impact on predatory mites has been reported by researchers. This has lead to the development of mancozeb spray programmes in vines and other crops with a much reduced impact on predatory mites. A range of field studies was conducted in France, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain where either 2 or 4 applications of mancozeb containing products were made per season at different spray timings. These trials covered the representative range of uses, agronomic practices, mite species and geographical locations in Europe. In this paper findings from ten field studies in five different vine growing regions in Europe indicated that two to four applications of mancozeb at 1.6 kg a.i./ha as part of a spray programme caused minimal impact on naturally occurring populations of predatory mites which in turn was compatible with Integrated Pest Management programmes and the conservation of predatory mites.

The highest proportion recorded locally was 3%. Hares of all age groups were infected during the winter. The proportion of animals showing a positive response was highest in elderly hares. The field-mouse population level probably affects the incidence of infection to a considerable extent. The risk of infection is not sex-related. Unlike the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, infection with L. interrogans serotype grippotyphosa in the Netherlands is only observed rarely in farm and small animals despite the fact that this serotype is very common locally. Antibodies to serotypes icterohaemorrhagiae, saxkoebing, bratislava and poi were occasionally detected; antibodies to serotype bratislava were present in most cases in hares which also showed antibodies to serotype grippotyphosa.

Mycobacterium bovis, the aetiological agent of bovine tuberculosis (TB), is one such pathogen. The incidence of TB in cattle has increased substantially in parts of Great Britain in the past two decades, adversely affecting the livelihoods of cattle farmers and potentially increasing the risks of human exposure. The control of bovine TB in Great Britain is complicated by the involvement of wildlife, particularly badgers (Meles meles), which appear to sustain endemic infection and can transmit TB to cattle. Between 1975 and 1997 over 20,000 badgers were culled as part of British TB control policy, generating conflict between conservation and farming interest groups. Here we present results from a large-scale field trial that indicate that localized badger culling not only fails to control but also seems to increase TB incidence in cattle.

Twenty-five years of biodynamic, bio-organic, or conventional management in the DOK long-term experiment in Switzerland significantly altered soil bacterial community structures, as assessed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis. To evaluate these results, the relation between bacterial diversity and bacterial community structures and their discrimination potential were investigated by sequence and T-RFLP analyses of 1,904 bacterial 16S rRNA gene clones derived from the DOK soils. Standard anonymous diversity indices such as Shannon, Chao1, and ACE or rarefaction analysis did not allow detection of management-dependent influences on the soil bacterial community. Bacterial community structures determined by sequence and T-RFLP analyses of the three gene libraries substantiated changes previously observed by soil bacterial community level T-RFLP profiling. This supported the value of high-throughput monitoring tools such as T-RFLP analysis for assessment of differences in soil microbial communities. The gene library approach also allowed identification of potential management-specific indicator taxa, which were derived from nine different bacterial phyla. These results clearly demonstrate the advantages of community structure analyses over those based on anonymous diversity indices when analyzing complex soil microbial communities.

J		Article		Micro-scale distribution of microorganisms and microbial enzyme activities in a soil with long-term organic amendment.		Poll, C.; Thiede, A.; Wermbter, N.; Sessitsch, A.; Kandeler, E. (kandeler@uni-hohenheim.de)									European Journal of Soil Science		2003	December 2003	54	4	715-724	715	724	English	print					Microbial ecology is the key to understanding the function of biodiversity for organic matter cycling in the soil. We have investigated the impacts of farmyard manure added over 120 years on organic matter content, enzyme activities, total microbial biomass and structure of microbial populations in several particle-size fractions of a Luvic Phaeozem a few kilometres northeast of Halle, Germany. We compared two treatments: no fertilization (control) and 12t farmyard manure (FYM) ha-1 year-1 since 1878. The fine fractions contained most C and N, microbial biomass, total amount of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and greatest invertase activity. Xylanase activity as well as fungal biomass increased only gradually with diminishing particle size, whereas the relative abundance of fungi decreased with diminishing particle size. The least diversity of the soil microbial community, indicated by the smallest Shannon index based on the abundance and amount of different PLFAs and small number of terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) of 16S rRNA genes, was in the sand fractions. The results supported the hypothesis that this microhabitat is colonized by a less complex bacterial community than the silt and clay fractions. Addition of FYM had enhanced the amount of organic matter, total microbial biomass, and xylanase and invertase activity, and induced a shift of the microbial community towards a more bacteria-dominated community in the coarse sand fraction. Microbial communities in finer fractions were less affected by addition of FYM.

J		Article		The status of foxes Vulpes vulpes on the Isle of Man in 1999.		Reynolds, Jonathan C. (jreynolds@gct.org.uk) ; Short, Mike J.									Mammal Review		2003	March 2003	33	1	69-76	69	76	English	print					1. Foxes Vulpes vulpes probably did not occur naturally on the Isle of Man, but were present in small numbers in the mid 19th century. They were introduced again in the 1980s, and in 1990 the population was estimated at 120-300 individuals (20-50 per 100 km2) on the basis of field signs. We used a nocturnal spotlight transect survey technique to assess the status of foxes on the Isle of Man in September 1999. This method had previously been used effectively to estimate fox densities in populations as sparse as 16 per 100 km2. We surveyed a total of 852 km over a period of eight consecutive nights, during weather conditions which allowed excellent visibility. No foxes were seen. 2. By comparison with equivalent survey efforts in reference areas of mainland Britain, we conclude that post-breeding fox density on the Isle of Man was certainly below 2.5 per 100 km2, implying a maximum of 15 foxes on the entire island. We estimate a probability of only 15-25% that a fox population of 1 per 100 km2 was present but not detected; this would be equivalent to only five or six individuals on the whole island. Foxes may even be entirely absent, although unsubstantiated sightings continue to be reported. 3. This finding is significant in understanding the ecology of the Isle of Man, and in planning the conservation of a number of ground-nesting bird species there, as well as for farming interests, and for contingency planning against an accidental introduction of rabies.

J		Article		Prospective pathomorphological, immunological, and mycological results concerning chronic fungal sinusitis		May, A. (Angelika.May@em.uni-frankfurt.de) ; Lehne, C.; Lambrecht, E.; Enzensberger, R.; Brade, V.; Gstottner, W.; Weber, A.									Allergologie		2004	March 2004	27	3	95-101	95	101	German	print					Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a disease very frequently encountered by otorhino-laryngologists. According to Ponikau et al. fungi are accused to trigger eosinophilic CRS. Other authors quote fungi to cause CRS in only up to 10%. In Germany, data concerning fungal rhinosinusitis in CRS patients are rare. Therefore, a study on 51 patients with CRS and 10 controls was conducted. Nasal mucus was collected by cotton sponges (group A, n = 39) or by flushing the nose (group B, n = 12), the controls were treated respectively. Nasal secretions were processed for microbiology, fungal cultivation and cytology. Fungi and eosinophiles were visualised by microscopic study of smears in Pappenheim and Grocott. Skin prick tests and specific IgE measurements were done to evaluate an atopy. Five (12%) patients in group A and I patient (8%) in group B had positive fungal cultures. Altogether, from 6 (12%) patients with CRS and 2 controls fungi were cultivated. The species identified were Aspergillus, Alternaria, Aureobasidium, Candida, Cladosporium, Penicillium. Fourteen (36%) patients in group A and 2 (16%) in group B showed fungi on microscopic examination. So, in 16 (31%) patients with CRS fungi were found in the cytological preparations, 1 control was positive. In 3 patients, skin prick tests and specific antigen against fungi correlated with the microscopic and mycological findings. Our data indicate that allergic fungal rhinosinusitis can occur in 6% of CRS. In 31% of CRS fungi were found in nasal mucus. If in such patients conventional treatment fails, new therapeutic strategies could be of relevance.

Folia Microbiologica		2004		49	5	601-604	601	604	English	print					Mycological analysis of swabs and scraping samples from the external ear canals of 40 patients with clinically diagnosed otomycosis (10 neonates, 30 adults) revealed the presence of fungi as etiological agents. They were investigated microscopically using 20 % potassium hydroxide, and by cultivation on Sabouraud's glucose agar. The Candida species were identified using the germ-tube test, micromorphology observations of colonies on rice agar, and particularly by the commercial kit AUXAcolor. The following Candida species were identified in the aural material examined: C. albicans (n = 2 1; 52.5 %), C parapsilosis (11; 27.5), C tropicalis (3; 7.5), C. krusei (3; 7.5), C. guilliermondii (2; 5.0). The above yeasts were present in samples together with Staphylococcus epidermidis (31), S. aureus (16), (X-hemolytic streptococci (14), Neisseria spp. (14), Proteus mirabilis (3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Escherichia coli (1) and Haemophilus influenzae (1). The most frequent predisposing factors for otomycosis were swimming in public pools and/or bath, spa and diabetes mellitus.

The current BSE situation in Europe is reviewed, and focus is particularly made on the increasing occurrence in Portugal and France, as well as the late occurrence of BSE in an indigenous Danish cow. The occurrence of BSE in other animal species, and particularly experimental transmissions of BSE and scrapie between sheep and cattle, are summarized. The possibility that sheep are infected with BSE cannot be ruled out as yet. Legislation in GB, EU and Norway is summarized, and short mentioning is made of recent diagnostic techniques. The risk of BSE infection in cattle or sheep in Norway is regarded to be very small to negligible.

J		Article		Ecological and life-history traits related to range contractions among breeding birds in Japan		Amano, Tatsuya (amatatsu@affrc.go.jp) ; Yamaura, Yuichi (yamaura@affrc.go.jp)									Biological Conservation		2007	JUN 2007	137	2	271-282	271	282	English						Extinction risk is not evenly distributed among all species. Therefore, identifying shared characteristics of species that have shown serious population declines and range contractions can help to predict which types of species are likely to be vulnerable to extinction. The present study investigates ecological and life-history traits related to range contractions among breeding birds in Japan. Recent changes in nationwide distribution of each species were estimated using data from distributional surveys of breeding area in Japanese birds (1978 and 1998-2002). The Phylogenetic generalised least squares model revealed that the species with the following five traits have experienced particularly severe range contractions: medium body size, low annual productivity, solitary breeding, occurrence on farmland, and long-distance migration. Earlier theoretical studies have revealed that species with medium body sizes and low annual productivities are vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation. Thus, results from the present study, which showed a decline in species with those two traits, may be indicating that habitat loss and fragmentation play an important role in range contractions in Japanese birds too. Whether, and through which mechanisms, coloniality reduces extinction risks of populations remains to be investigated. A large number of studies, mainly in Europe, have revealed the mechanisms behind the declines in farmland birds and long-distance migrants. In Japan, however, few studies have explored the processes through which such species decline.

J		Article		Compositional shifts of bacterial groups in a solarized and amended soil as determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis		Gelsomino, Antonio (agelsomino@unirc.it) ; Cacco, Giovanni									Soil Biology & Biochemistry		2006	JAN 2006	38	1	91-102	91	102	English						Soil solarization is a widespread, nonchemical-agricultural practice for disinfesting soils, which is often used in combination with organic amendment, and whose action represents an important factor impacting on soil bacterial communities structure and population dynamics. The present study was conducted to investigate whether and to which extent a 72-day plot-scale soil solarization treatment, either combined or not with organic amendment, could stimulate compositional changes in the genetic structure of indigenous soil bacterial communities. Soil solarization with transparent polyethylene film, in combination or not with farmyard manure addition, was carried out during a summer period on a clay loam agricultural soil located in Southern Italy. Soils from a four-treatment (NS, nonsolarized control soil; S, solarized soil; MA, manure-amended nonsolarized soil; MS, manure-amended and solarized soil) plot block were sampled after 0, 8, 16, 36 and 72 days. Compositional shifts in the genetic structure of indigenous soil bacterial communities were monitored by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting of 16S rRNA gene fragments amplified from soil-extracted community DNA using primers specific for Bacteria, Actinomycetales, alpha- and beta-Proteobacteria. Changes in soil temperature, pH, and electrical conductivity (EC1:1) were also monitored from 0 to 72 days. Beneath the polyethylene film the average soil temperature at 8-cm depth reached 55 degrees C compared to 35 degrees C in nonsolarized soil. In general, without amendment both soil pH and EC1:1 were not significantly affected by solarization, whereas in manured plots either variables were greatly increased (from 7.0 to 8.0 pH and from 271 to 3021 mu S cm(-1) EC1:1), and both showed long-lasting effects due to soil solar heating. The eubacterial DGGE profiles revealed that soil solarization was the main factor inducing strong time-dependent population shifts in the community structure either in unamended or amended soils. Conversely, the addition of organic amendment resulted in an altered bacterial community, which remained rather stable over time. A similar behaviour was also observed in the DGGE patterns of beta-proteobacterial and actinomycete populations, and also, albeit to a lesser extent, in the DGGE profiles of alpha-Proteobacteria. An increased bacterial richness was evidenced by DGGE fingerprints in 16- and 36-day samplings, followed by a decrease appearing in 72-day samplings. This could be explained, other than by a direct thermal effect on soil microflora, by solarization-induced changes in the physico-chemical properties of soil microbial habitats or by other ecological factors (e.g. decreased competitiveness of dominating bacterial species, reduced grazing pressure of microfaunal predators, increased nutrient availability).

H. pullorum isolates were examined by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprinting for interstrain genetic diversity and relatedness. Sixteen isolates from cecal samples from 2 different flocks were obtained. AFLP analysis showed that these isolates and 4 additional isolates from a different flock clustered according to their origin, which indicates that H. pullorum colonization may occur with a single strain that disseminates throughout the flock. Strains isolated from different hosts or geographic sources displayed a distinctive pattern. H. pullorum is present in approximately one third of live chickens in Belgium and may represent a risk to human health.

The aim of this study was to examine the distribution and determinants of C. burnetii past infection in Northern Ireland (NI). Coxiella burnetii phase II specific IgG antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in stored serum from 2394 randomly selected subjects, aged 12-64, who had participated in population-based surveys of cardiovascular risk factors performed in 1986 and 1987. The overall prevalence of C. burnetii antibody positivity was 12.8%. The prevalence of sero-positivity was slightly higher in males than that in females (14.3% versus 11.2%, P = 0.02). Sero-positivity was low in children (<10%), increasing to 19.5% and 16.4% in males and females, respectively, in the 25-34 age group and subsequently remaining fairly steady with increasing age. Sero-positivity among farmers, at 48.8%, was significantly higher than the general population. More sero-positive than sero-negative women had a history of a miscarriage or still-birth (19.5% versus 9.8%, P < 0.001). In conclusion, this study demonstrated a high prevalence of evidence of past C. burnetii infection in NI. Associations between past C. burnetii infection and age, sex, social class, occupation and reproductive history were seen. We estimate that 20% of Q fever infections in NI occur in farmers.

Samples for Campylobacter culture, which consisted of 14 cloacal swabs per flock, were collected from one house on each farm prior to the first depopulation of birds. In total 388 flocks were sampled, of which 163 tested positive for Campylobacter spp. (42.0%; 95% CI 35.1-48.9%).Data on farm and flock variables were obtained from questionnaires and random-effects logistic regression modelling used to investigate the association between these and the Campylobacter status of flocks. Six variables, all of which were significant at p < 0.05, were included in the final multivariable model. These included a combined variable on the presence of rodents on farms, which showed an increased odds of infection in flocks where the farmer reported having observed rodents during the production cycle (OR = 2.1) and/or where rodent droppings were observed at the sampling visit (OR = 2.9). Other variables that were significantly associated with an increased odds of infection included the age of the birds at sampling (odds ratio for its linear effect = 1.16 for each day of increase in age), season (summer versus other seasons OR = 2.0), farms with three or more broiler houses (OR = 2.9 compared to those with one house), the frequency of footbath disinfectant changes (OR = 2.5 for once weekly and OR = 4.0 for less than once weekly compared to twice weekly changes) and a categorical variable on the standard of tidiness and cleanliness of the broiler house ante-room (OR = 2.0 and OR = 4.9 for flocks from houses with poorer standards). There was no significant evidence of direct carry-over of infection from one production cycle to the next, neither was there evidence of other farm species acting as a source of infection.

J	10341053	Article		Phylogenetic diversity and population densities of culturable cellulolytic soil bacteria across an agricultural encatchment		Ulrich, A.; Wirth, S.									Microbial Ecology		1999	May, 1999	37	4	238-247	238	247	English	print					A typical, small encatchment (catena Boelkendorf) in the moraine, northeast German agricultural landscape Schorfheide-Chorin was studied with respect to summit, midslope, and foot-slope positions at northern and southern slope exposure, respectively, including a central noncultivated kettle hole position (pot hole). Across the sequence of seven distinct sampling positions, soil organic carbon and total nitrogen contents, soil gravimetric water content, and soil microbial biomass displayed maxima at the kettle hole position. Soil pH revealed a decreasing trend at the northern exposed slope and a minimum at the kettle hole position. Against this background, the population density of total culturable bacteria clearly displayed a minimum at the kettle hole position, whereas the population density of carboxymethylcellulose decomposing bacteria was not clearly differentiated in relation to sampling positions. To study the phylogenetic diversity of culturable cellulolytic bacteria, 311 isolates were obtained from the sampling positions across the entire encatchment and examined by restriction analysis of PCR-amplified 16S rDNA. Using the restriction enzyme ScrFI, isolates were classified into 31 pattern groups. Although the ratio of actinomycetes within total isolates ranged from 0.73 to 0.94, only 16 pattern groups originated from actinomycetes, but 15 from other bacteria. At all sampling positions, a dominant pattern group was identified, containing 38 to 65% of total isolates. Two site-specific pattern groups could be identified, representing significant parts of the total population, which were highly specific for the kettle hole (19% of total isolates) and for foot- and midslope positions (15-18% of total isolates), respectively. In general, the composition of cellulolytic isolates across the encatchment displayed differences with respect to slope positions, but was not significantly affected by soil properties. Based on 16S rDNA sequence analysis, isolates of the dominant as well as the specific pattern groups could be assigned to the genus Streptomyces. Furthermore, sequencing of 16S rDNA of isolates of another three pattern groups revealed a high phylogenetic diversity among these isolates, including cellulomonads and bacilli.

J		Article		Yield reduction caused by a soil-borne disease of naked, dwarf, and conventional oat in Finland		Peltonen-Sainio, Pirjo; Valkonen, Jari P. T.; Koponen, Hilkka									Agricultural and Food Science in Finland		1996		5	4	475-483	475	483	English						A severe disease occurred in the field plots of naked (cv. Salomon), dwarf (cv. Pal), and conventional oat (cvs. Jalostettu maatiainen and Salo) at the Viikki Experimental Farm of the University of Helsinki, Finland, in 1994 and 1995. Symptoms were expressed as grayish-brown necrotic areas on the lower leaves which killed plants from the seedling to heading stage, the effect being cultivar dependent. The proportion of plants killed contributed to the yield losses. The infection also resulted in less grains per panicle and lower weight of both panicle and vegetative above-ground biomass. From a total of 57 fungal isolates obtained from infected leaves. Fusarium culmorum (W.G.Sm.) Sacc. and F. sambucinum Fuck. dominated and subsequently caused infection (particularly foot and root rot) in oat in laboratory tests. These two Fusarium spp. were considered to be the primary causal agents of the symptoms observed in the field, although other pathogens may have been present. The disease was probably soil-borne. The results of this study suggested that the unusually dry and warm weather during late June and in July was the principal factor behind the severe disease outbreak.	Peltonen-Sainio, Pirjo; Dep.

Three sampling surveys were carried out in June and September 2000 and June 2001 in order to make three types of temporal comparisons: (i) on a seasonal scale, before and after a summer dystrophic event; (ii) on an annual basis, before and after the works of excavation of a canal through the outer sand bank; (iii) on a multiannual scale, comparing the data with those of a survey carried out in 1988. The biocoenoses did not show large fluctuations after a moderately severe summer dystrophic crisis, while the digging of the canal caused clear changes in the macrobenthos community structure after one year.

J		Article		Unpublished records of the flora in Finland from the 17(th)-49(th) centuries. 2. K. A. Gottlund's herbarium of an island in Helsinki in 1843 indicates extinct and invading vascular plant species during 160 years of changing environment and nativeness before sown forage cultivation		Ahokas, Hannu (hannu.ahokas@mtt.fi)									Memoranda Societatis pro Fauna et Flora Fennica		2008		84	1	1-19	1	19	English						K. A. Gottlund's ignored manuscripts give names of 246 seed plant taxons, an alga and tens of mushrooms collected in 1843 by him on the Isosaari (Mjolo) Island, then uninhabited, on the Gulf of Finland, 10 kin SE of Helsinki. It represented the first rich herbarium of a confined area in Finland. Gottlund had studied botany both in Turku and, under K. P. Thunberg, in Uppsala University. The collection preceded forage cultivation on fields in Finland giving data about some later forage and their weed species having also native origins. In his harbarium, Armeria maritima, Dactylis glomerata and Phleum nodosum are thought to be among the several native species of Isosaari (vs. archaeophytes) as also sporadically elsewhere on the coastal stripe and archipelago of Finland. Of the two subarctic relict species P alpinum and Agrostis mertensii on Isosaari, the former was later also found on the Suursaari Island. The occurrence of Deschampsia bottnica was also recognised in W. Nylander's papers in 1850 and 1851 (Nylander 1850-1852) listing 12 additional vascular plant species of Isosaari. Several other species on Isosaari were not refound in surveys about I 10 years and about 150 years later or were threatened on Isosaari, in the whole Helsinki territory, and some of them, countrywide. The number of found Carex species on Isosaari declined to less than 50% in about I 10 years. Tens of species of vascular plants may have disappeared from Isosaari and been displaced by tens of new species during 110-150 years. Increase in oxidized sulfur and nutritive nitrogen precipitated and rise in annual mean temperature by > 1 degrees C may partly be responsible for the changes in the vegetation on Isosaari associated with an increase in transportation carrying plant propagules, with constructions on the island and with the emissions from the increasing ferry and tanker traffic on the Gulf of Finland. Gottlund's method of conservation of mushrooms was also notified in St.Petersburg in 1844. The herbarium of mushrooms, partly determined by E. Fries (Uppsala) in 1844-1850, was probably the first of kind in Finland.

S	S22-S28	S22	S28	English						In the contest of the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus through Eurasia during 2005, a surveillance study of wild birds was launched in early 2006 within the framework of regional Technical Cooperation Programmes of Food and Agliculture Organization in several countries of eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. From mid-January to rnid-May 2006, field campaigns were conducted in 14 countries, including recently infected countries. In total, 5,256 samples were collected in large wetland areas where Eurasian and Afro-tropical waterbirds congregate. The overall prevalence of avian influenza viruses detected by RT-PCR was 3.3%, with no positivity for HPAI H5N1 virus. Five distinctvirus isolates were obtained from the RT-PCR-positive samples. Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses were detected and isolated in both Eurasian and Afro-tropical bird species, indicating that low pathogenic viruses were circulating in Africa during the northern winter. These findings reveal that LPAI virus persists in wild birds in subtropical environments and support the hypothesis that avian influenza viruses could be perpetuated in wild birds throughout the year, including in Palearctic waterbirds wintering in sub-Sabaran Africa before their northward spring migration.

The strawberries were planted on an organic farm north of Vienna in spring 2000. The following characteristics were evaluated during the season 2001: number of plants, soil coverage, total and marketable yield, average fruit weight, susceptibility to grey mould (Botrytis cinerea), powdery mildew (Sphaerotheca macularis) and leaf spots (Mycosphaerella fragariae), as well as the infestation by the strawberry blossom weevil (Anthonomus rubi) and thrips (Thrips spp.). In addition different parameters of fruit quality were analysed and storage tests and sensory analyses were carried out. On the basis of the present results the two varieties 'Honeoye' and 'Symphony' can be recommended for organic production in Austria.

J		Article		Parasite pressure and its effects on blood parameters in a stable and dense population of the endangered lesser grey shrike		Valera, Francisco (pvalera@eeza.csic.es) ; Hoi, Herbert; Kristin, Anton									Biodiversity and Conservation		2006	JUN 2006	15	7	2187-2195	2187	2195	English						The risk that pathogens and parasites pose to endangered species is increasingly evident. Nonetheless, this is frequently overlooked when considering causes of decline of species and conservation practices. Here, we study the ecto and haemoparasites of adult and nestling Lesser grey shrikes Lanius minor from a dense and stable breeding population in central Europe and their effect on host blood parameters. We found three species of haemoparasites (Haemoproteus sp., microfilariae tentatively assigned to the family Splendidofilariae and Trypanosoma sp.) and two ectoparasite taxa (Menacanthus camelinus and feather mites - Acarina-). Our data suggest that the studied population, located in an area with traditional and extensive farming, is not under a strong parasite pressure. Despite this, indirect measures of immunocompetence (haematocrit and sedimentation rate) showed an association between haemoparasites and health status: while haematocrit did not differ between parasitised and non-parasitised individuals, adult shrikes with haematozoa had significantly lower sedimentation rates than did non-parasitised birds.

J		Article		Determination of the etiological agent of brown ring disease in southwestern Spain		Castro, D.; Santamaria, J. A.; Luque, A.; Martinez-Manzanares, E.; Borrego, J. J.									Diseases of Aquatic Organisms		1997		29	3	181-188	181	188	English						Since 1989 the presence of organic brown deposits on the inner surface of the shells of cultured manila clams Tapes philippinarum associated with episodes of high mortality has been recorded on the southern Atlantic coast of Spain. The gross signs observed in diseased clams were identical to those previously described in France as brown ring disease (BRD), caused by strains of Vibrio tapetis sp. nov. This bacterial pathogen has been isolated in several French clam production areas, and recently in BRD-affected clams cultured in Galicia (NW Spain) and Portugal, using bacteriological procedures. However, this methodology has failed to detect the pathogen in microbiological studies carried out in southwestern Spain. In the present study, an immunodetection test, based on the indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) technique, was developed, using polyclonal antisera to V. tapetis whole cells and against outer membrane (OM). This method provided evidence for the presence of the bacterium in all the BRD-affected clams analysed. V. tapetis was also detected by the same method in healthy (i.e. asymptomatic) clams, which indicates its opportunistic character.	Borrego, J. J.; Dep. Microbiol., Fac.

J	16686162	Article		Spatial distribution of nymphs of Scaphoideus titanus (Homoptera : Cicadellidae) in grapes, and evaluation of sequential sampling plans		Lessio, Federico; Alma, Alberto									Journal of Economic Entomology		2006	APR 2006	99	2	578-582	578	582	English						The spatial distribution of the nymphs of Scaphoideus titantis Ball (Homoptera Cicadellidae), the vector of grapevine flavescence doree (Candidatus Phytoplasma vitis, 16Sr-V), was studied by applying Taylor's power law. Studies were conducted from 2002 to 2005, in organic and conventional vineyards of Piedmont, northern Italy. Minimum sample size and fixed precision level stop lines were calculated to develop appropriate sampling plans. Model validation was performed, using independent field data, by means of Resampling Validation of Sample Plans (RVSP) resampling software. The nymphal distribution, analyzed via Taylor's power law, was aggregated, with b = 1.49. A sample of 32 plants was adequate at low pest densities with a precision level of D-O = 0.30; but for a more accurate estimate (D-O = 0.10), the required sample size needs to be 292 plants. Green's fixed precision level stop lines seem to be more suitable for field sampling: RVSP simulations of this sampling plan showed precision levels very close to the desired levels. However, at a prefixed precision level of 0.10, sampling would become too time-consuming, whereas a precision level of 0.25 is easily achievable. How these results could influence the correct application of the compulsory control of S. titanus and Flavescence doree in Italy is discussed.

J		Article		Litter decomposition and microbial characteristics in agricultural soils in northern, central, and southern Germany		Dilly, Oliver (o.dilly@ifb.uni-hamburg.de) ; Munch, Jean Charles									Soil Science and Plant Nutrition		2004	December 2004	50	6	843-853	843	853	English	print					Decomposition of litter and soil organic matter are controlled by temperature, water availability, substrate quality, and soil microbial activities. How the decomposition process and soil microbial communities interact is, however, not well understood. Therefore, litter decomposition rates were studied in situ in comparable soil units, predominantly Luvisols, at three locations in northern, central, and southern Germany and abiotic factors and microbial characteristics were concurrently investigated at four times. The ash-free mass of Triticum, Secale, and Lolium litter remaining after 180 d of field exposure in litter bags was 68, 50, and 15% respectively. For Lolium litter, the highest decomposition rate occurred at the central German site. In contrast, the refractory Secale and Triticum litter was decomposed more rapidly at the northern and southern site where inorganic N was fertilised and plants with N2 symbiosis were predominant respectively. Rapidly degrading Lolium litter was extensively colonised by microorganisms at the early stages, by successively decreased. When looking at the whole investigation period, the microbial properties in the litter did frequently not differ significantly between the locations. However, the interactions determined between decomposition time, litter type and location indicated that microbial characteristics including metabolic-responsive biomass, carbon availability index, metabolic, and respiratory quotient varied site-specifically dependent litter quality. The refractory Triticum litter was most rapidly degraded in the microbiologically active soil, in contrast to N-rich Lolium litter.

J		Article		Review of the national restocking programme "Active protection of native crayfish in Poland" 1999-2001		Smietana, P. (leptosp@univ.szczecin.pl) ; Krzywosz, T.; Struzynski, W.									Bulletin Francais de la Peche et de la Pisciculture		2004			372-73	289-299	289	299	English	print					After the first spread of crayfish plague (aphanomycosis) at the end of the nineteenth century, the formerly abundant populations of native crayfish in Poland declined drastically. Analysis of historical data on the occurrence and distribution of crayfish in Poland led to the conclusion that without human intervention the native crayfish species would be at high risk of being made extinct. The largest programme concerning crayfish monitoring and restocking in Poland was "Active protection of native crayfish in Poland" conducted by the Inland Fisheries Institute, the Department of Ecology, University of Szczecin, the Department of Zoology, Warsaw Agricultural University and the University of Warmia and Mazury that was funded by the EkoFundusz Foundation and Inland Fisheries Institute in 1999-2001. One of the main objectives and results of this programme was the determination of indigenous crayfish distribution in Poland (mainly Astacus astacus and Astacus leptodactylus) and the restocking of suitable habitats with indigenous crayfish. The densest populations (> 2 500 adult individuals per hectare) were used as a source of restocking material. Restocking was performed in 54 water bodies using a total of 45 200 individuals of A. astacus and 9 800 of A. leptodactylus. Between 2001-2002, the success of the restocking programme was monitored. According to the results obtained so far, the restocking exercise has been successful in at least 60.8% of the cases.

(marja-liisa.hanninen@helsinki.fi)									Poultry Science		2007	JUN 2007	86	6	1223-1228	1223	1228	English						A total of 642 fecal samples and 360 table eggs from Finnish organic laying hens were collected in autumn 2003 (19 farms) and spring 2004 (17 farms) and studied for the presence of Campylobacter. In autumn, 84% of the farms were positive for Campylobacter and in spring, 76%. The percentage of positive samples within a flock varied between 5 and 100%. In addition, Campylobacter was isolated in a single eggshell sample. Campylobacter jejuni was the species isolated most often, although Campylobacter coli was detected on 3 farms in autumn and on 4 farms in spring. KpnI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis genotyping revealed a high level of diversity among the isolates; 47 different patterns were detected among a total of 162 isolates studied. On most of the farms, the geno-types identified in autumn and spring were different, also indicating temporal diversity among colonizing isolates. However, some predominant persistent genotypes were also detected among the isolates. These results suggest that the pool of colonizing isolates may include both variants with capability for persistent intestinal colonization in hens as well as variants with short-term colonization characteristics. In antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the majority of isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, ampicillin, and nalidixic acid. On 2 farms, isolates resistant to nalidixic acid and to ciprofloxacin were detected. In conclusion, Finnish organic laying hens are often colonized by a diversity of Campylobacter pulse-dfield gel electrophoresis genotypes.

J		Article		ChAnge, Stress, Sustainability and Aquatic ecosystem Resilience In North African wetland lakes during the 20th century: An introduction to integrated biodiversity studies within the CASSARINA project		Flower, R. J.									Aquatic Ecology		2001	October, 2001	35	3-4	261-280	261	280	English	print					The CASSARINA Project is a co-ordinated joint study of recent environmental change in North African wetland lakes. Nine primary sites were selected for detailed study comprising three sites in each of Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt. Multi-disciplinary studies were undertaken by scientists from each of these countries working in cooperation with colleagues in the UK and Norway. The detailed results are presented in a consecutive suite of papers that describe both modern ecosystem attributes and the recent environmental histories of each site. This paper presents an overview of the aims, structure and initial results of the project. Modern site attributes measured were water quality and phytoplankton (Fathi et al., 2001), zooplankton (Ramdani et al., 2001b), fish (Kraiem et al., 2001) and littoral vegetation (Ramdani et al., 2001a). Baseline water quality data showed that one site (Megene Chitane) was acid with low salinity but the others had high alkalinities with varying degrees of brackishness. All the sites tended to be eutrophic and the phytoplankton was mainly dominated by green or blue-green algae. Where fish were present, growth rates were high with marginally highest rates in the Egyptian Delta lakes (Kraiem et al., 2001). Marginal vegetation surveys showed that emergent macrophytes were still extensive only in the Delta lakes (Ramdani et al., 2001a) where they form important refuges and restrict water pollution. In 1998, one Moroccan wetland lake (Merja Bokka) was drained completely for cultivation. Site specific environmental change records for the 20th century period were obtained using palaeolimnological techniques. Sediment core chronologies (Appleby et al., 2001) were based mainly on radio-isotopes (210Pb and 137Cs). Sedimentary remains of aquatic biota, diatoms, zooplankton, higher plants and benthic animals (Flower et al., 2001; Ramdani et al., 2001c; Birks et al., 2001a) and pollen (Peglar et al., 2001) were investigated (Birks et al., 2001b). Major differences in past species abundances were found and were interpreted in terms relevant to biodiversity and water quality/availability change. Metals and pesticide residues in sediment cores indicated that lake contamination was generally lower than in some European sites but some DDE profiles showed a close correspondence with known usage histories (Peters et al., 2001). Hydrological changes affecting water quality and availability mainly arose from land-use intensification during the 20th century and are shown to be the main driver of biodiversity disturbance at all nine CASSARINA sites. Summarizing floristic and faunistic changes using species richness values indicated that freshening of the Delta lakes during this century generally increased aquatic diversity. Species richness also increased during the final drainage of Bokka but tended to decline in acid Chitane. Modern sampling showed that phytoplankton and epiphytic diatom diversity was higher in the Delta lakes but this was not so for zooplankton. Each biological group reacted differently to environmental disturbance and this lack of concordance makes overall diversity changes difficult to predict. Implications of the combined study are that water quality and availability changes through landuse intensification remain the greatest imminent threat to the ecological integrity of remaining North African wetland lakes. For most sites, recent changes in freshwater supply have occurred causing sometimes catastrophic changes in lake biota (Bokka). The acid lake (Chitane) supports an acidophilous biota that is unique in Tunisia but habitat quality is currently diminishing due to both enrichment and inflow water abstraction. However, sediment records indicate that earlier in the 20th century many of the CASSARINA sites experienced temporarily enhanced freshwater supply from land irrigation and drainage improvements. This was especially marked for the Delta lakes and these remain the most biodiverse sites today. Intensified time-space multi-disciplinary environmental monitoring of aquatic ecosystems is identified as a key activity for effective wetland lake management and for validating future environmental change scenarios in North Africa.

J		Technical Report		Modelling of the compost and transport process in the ORWARE simulation model		Sonesson, Ulf									Sveriges Lantbruksuniversitet Institutionen for Lantbruksteknik Rapport		1996		0	214	I-III, 1-32	I		English						The system for handling and treatment organic waste is very large and complex, especially in urban areas. It consists of numerous transports, different treatments and different use of residual products. This system also interacts with several other technical systems in society, e.g., district heating, handling of other wastes and material for re-use, and agriculture as a receiver of residues. The complexity of the system under study makes a systematic approach necessary to get the appropriate overview, which has led to the construction of the simulation model ORWARE (Organic Waste Research). This model is intended as a means of analysing the environmental impact, use of resources, and energy turnover of the handling system for organic waste. The model consists of treatment facilities for waste in the system as well as all the transports necessary for collecting the waste and transport residual products to landfills or arable land. ORWARE is modular, all sub-models can be connected to each other. The sub-models developed are: sewage plant; incineration; landfill; composting; anaerobic digestion; transports; and spreading of residues on arable land. ORWARE is used as a scenario tool, the scenarios that are to be studied are constructed by connecting the sub-models needed to represent the scenario and a simulation is performed. An analysis of a region consists of simulation of several scenarios and then evaluation mainly of the differences between the results. The results from the model are: air emissions from the entire system; water emissions from the entire system; energy turnover for the entire system; and amount of plant nutrients and contaminants recycled to arable land. These total emissions can also, in the analysis of the results, be presented as emission/energy turnover/plant nutrient recycled, from every single source. One way of making the results easier to analyse, is to use Life Cycle Assessment methodology to group the emissions into several environmental effect categories, and this is what have been done in the case studies performed. In this report, the modelling of, and indata to, the "compost model", the "transport model" and the "Transport Distances for Residual Products to Arable land model" are presented.

Investigations on the pathogenesis of brucellosis reveal that the etiologic agent can survive in phagocytic cells, and cell-mediated immunity plays an important role in immunity against bacteria. Methods: In this study, we investigated whether supplementation of levamisole, a well-known antihelminthic agent with immune-stimulating activity to conventional antibiotic therapy, would improve the anergy against Brucella. Results: The results of our study reveal that a 6-week course of levamisole as a supplement to conventional antibiotic therapy in chronic brucellosis is not superior to conventional antibiotic treatment alone with respect to lymphocyte subgroup ratios and phagocytic function. Conclusion: In chronic brucellosis, levamisole administered as a supplement concomitantly with conventional antibiotic therapy has no immunostimulating effect on the basis of the lymphocyte subgroups ratios measured and the ability of phagocytosis in the present study. Further large clinical and laboratory trials are necessary to investigate the immunological and physiological effects of levamisole on T-H1 subtypes and cytokine secretion. Copyright (C) 2005 S.

J		Article		Structural characteristics and plant-beneficial effects of bacteria colonizing the shoots of field grown conventional and genetically modified T4-lysozyme producing potatoes		Rasche, Frank (frank.rasche@arcs.ac.at) ; Marco-Noales, Ester; Velvis, Henk; van Overbeek, Leo S.; Lopez, Maria M.; van Elsas, Jan D.; Sessitsch, Angela									Plant and Soil		2006	NOV 2006	289	1-2	123-140	123	140	English						Genetically modified potatoes expressing antibacterial protein T4 lysozyme may offer effective control strategies for bacterial pathogens causing severe potato diseases. Apart from this beneficial effect, it is very important to investigate such engineered potatoes carefully for potential adverse effects on potato-associated bacteria which frequently exhibit plant beneficial functions such as plant growth promotion and antagonism towards pathogens invading the plant. Two field experiments were carried out in Spain to analyze the potential effects of conventional and genetically modified T4-lysozyme producing potatoes on shoot-associated bacteria. The first baseline field trial 2002 was performed in Meliana in which three conventional potato lines, Achirana Inta, Desiree, and Merkur, were cultivated and sampled at flowering. The second field trial was conducted in Cella in 2003 in order to compare the effects of a senescent transgenic, T4 lysozyme expressing potato trait, Desiree DL 12, with its isogenic, non-transformed parental line Desiree. Structural characteristics of potato shoot-associated bacteria was assayed by 16S rRNA-based terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis and dominant community members within T-RFLP profiles were identified by sequence analysis of generated 16S rRNA gene libraries. Cultivable bacteria isolated from shoots of potatoes grown in the Meliana field trial were monitored for antibiosis against Ralstonia solanacearum, whereas isolates derived from shoots of potatoes cultivated in the Cella trial were screened for antagonism against Ralstonia solanacearum and Rhizoctonia solani, and for 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase production. Determined antagonists were identified by 16S rRNA gene analysis. All potato traits hosted a cultivar-specific community of bacteria with antagonism against the pathogens and/or potential to produce ACC deaminase. Several antagonists obtained from the Cella field potatoes were also observed as ACC deaminase producers. Community profiling revealed a greater diversity differentiation between the senescent T4 lysozyme expressing and parental Desiree lines grown in the Cella field as compared to the variations between the three flowering conventional lines cultivated in the Meliana field trial. Effects of the two varying field sites and different vegetation stages were greater than those of T4 lysozyme when investigating the community composition of bacteria colonizing the shoots of the Desiree line cultivated in both field trials.

International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology		2002	May, 2002	52	3	901-911	901	911	English	print					A bacterial isolate, ME102T, was obtained from an n-hexadecane enrichment culture of seawater/sediment samples collected in the harbour of Messina (Italy). This Gram-negative, aerobic, motile, rod-shaped bacterium used a narrow spectrum of organic compounds, including aliphatic hydrocarbons, alkanoates and alkanoles, as carbon and energy sources. None of the sugars, organic acids or amino acids tested was used. During cultivation on n-alkanes as the sole source of carbon and energy, the cells formed a biofilm on the surface of the alkane droplets. Large-scale (sometimes >50% of the cell mass) intracellular accumulation of alkanoates occurred in cells adsorbed on the alkane surface and under nitrogen-limiting conditions. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that this isolate represents a distinct lineage in the gamma-Proteobacteria and has about 91% sequence identity to members of Marinobacter and Alcanivorax, the closest genera. Four different types of polar lipid could be detected, phosphatidyl glycerol, phosphatidyl ethylamine, phosphatidyl dimethylethylamine and lipids belonging to an unknown type of phospholipid (m/z between 861 and 879). The principal fatty acids in the polar lipid fatty acid profile were 16:0 and 16:1. The putative gene encoding the key enzyme of alkane catabolism, alkane hydroxylase (AlkB), has been cloned. The protein sequence of the putative AlkB of the isolate ME102T was related to the AlkB of Pseudomonas oleovorans and Alcanivorax borkumensis, showing about 60% sequence identity. On the basis of physiological studies and taking into account the distant phylogenetic position of isolate ME102T relative to previously described organisms, a novel genus and species is proposed, Oleiphilus messinensis gen. nov., sp. nov., within a new family, Oleiphilaceae fam. nov. Strain ME102T (=DSM 13489T=LMG 20357T) is the type and only strain of O. messinensis.

Therefore, fish farm raising rainbow trout and affiliated slaughterhouse and smoking plants were evaluated for the occurrence of Listeria monocytogenes. Samples including raw fish, swabbings of equipment or other surfaces, as well as processing water, salt, fish feed and fish samples taken after various stages of processing were collected from thirty different locations in the plant. For the detection of L. monocytogenes, both conventional and Listeria Rapid Test (LRT) were used. L. monocytogenes was detected in thirty out of sixty samples (50%) by LRT, while it was detected in thirty-four out of sixty samples (57%) by conventional method. No L. monocytogenes was detected from raw fish, smoked fish (before handling) and processing water, but it was detected in all environmental samples including swabbings of equipment or other surfaces and smoked fish samples after filleting.

In such an area there was also the Cabaj stream, the microbiological quality of which was monitored in a period covering March 1999-February 2001. Occurrence of the monitored physiological groups of microorganisms (coliform bacteria, actinomycetes, microscopic fungi, myxobacteria, lipolytic bacteria, and amylolytic bacteria) indicated that in the experimental years, the stream was polluted by post-consumer waste, vegetable waste, as well as soil. From March 1999 till February 2000, an increased supply of particularly easy degradable organic matters from faeces was observed in the Cabaj stream, and in a period of March 2000-February 2001, there were difficult degradable organic substances in the lower part of the stream. Also, the presence of typical representatives of soil microscopic fungi confirmed the stream pollution by different soil particles.

J		Article		The effect of a vector-borne disease on the dynamics of natural plant populations: A model for Ustilago violacea infection of Lychnis viscaria		Ingvarsson, Par K.; Lundberg, Sigfrid									Journal of Ecology		1993		81	2	263-270	263	270	English						1. A mathematical model was used to study how a parasitic castrating fungus affects the population dynamics of its host plant. The model is based on the interactions between the smut fungus Ustilago violacea and its host plant Lychnis viscaria. The model also includes the pollination process as this plays a central role in the transmission of the fungal spores between plants. 2. Analysis of the model, with the disease absent, revealed that the pollinators have a limiting effect on the growth rate of the population. The model did not include any other density-dependent processes. 3. A condition was calculated which had to be satisfied to enable the disease to invade the host population and it is shown that the disease must possess a minimum transmission potential to be able to invade the host population. The condition was entirely dependent on the demographic processes of the host plant. The higher the recruitment rate of the host, the easier it is for the pathogen successfully to invade the host population. 4. When the disease was able to invade the host population, the disease incidence varied with the transmission potential of the fungal spores. If the disease incidence rose above c. 50%, the host population was driven to local extinction. This was mainly because, at high disease incidence levels, the fraction of pollinators that carried pollen was almost non-existent. This lead to the transmission of the disease to all plants in the population and thus to the extinction of the entire host population.	Dep. Ecol., Theoretical Ecol., Ecol.

The results indicated that during its passage through the catchment, stream water became significantly contaminated with faecal coliform bacteria from the main agricultural land use inputs of livestock grazing and organic waste applications. Point sources of faecal coliform bacteria in terms of farmyard runoff, however, also appeared to be important in contributing to the spatial pattern of contamination. Significant temporal variation was observed in response to the hydrological behaviour of the catchment. Higher flows and more frequent washout of stored bacteria in winter and spring months led to lower faecal coliform concentrations than were detected during the summer. Maximum faecal coliform concentrations were measured during rainfall events and the varying responses associated with these helped to identify the importance of different sources of bacteria in the catchment and the mechanisms transferring them. The overall impact on the water quality of the Newmills Burn was considered as having a potentially serious threat to the health of downstream recreational users of the River Don, as well as to the large proportion of the local population who rely on private water supplies.

An example of a potentially troublesome reintroduction is the wild boar, which may act as a reservoir of diseases, e. g., classical swine fever, and cause high economic losses, and has become a species of concern in several European countries for both ecological and recreational reasons. Failure to prevent the disease consequences of species restoration can negate its conservation benefits. Here we evaluated the probability of both successfully reintroducing wild boar into Denmark and limiting their contact with domestic pig farms to which they might spread disease. For this purpose, we developed a spatially explicit, individual-based population model that incorporates information on boar habitat and demography information from Central European populations. We then compared model predictions with the spatial distribution of farms to achieve a spatial assessment of the contact risk. The most restrictive model scenario predicted that nearly 6% of Denmark provides habitat conditions that would allow wild boar to reproduce. The best habitats for reintroduction were aggregated in seven different areas throughout the country in which the extinction probability was < 5%. However, the expected population expansion was very limited in most of these areas. Both the number of suitable areas and the potential for population expansion greatly increased when we relaxed our habitat assumptions about boar forest requirements; this provided a more conservative scenario for a cautious risk analysis. We additionally found that part of the risk of contact with piggeries was associated with the magnitude of the expansion, although the nonrandom spatial pattern of farm distribution also had a strong influence. The partitioning of risks into those related to population expansion and those related to farm distribution allowed us to identify trade-offs between restoring boar populations and minimizing risks in different potential areas and under different risk scenarios; as a result, we rejected some of the particularly high-risk areas for potential reintroduction of the species. Our approach illustrates how the joint quantification of anticipated reintroduction success and associated risks can guide efforts aimed at reconciling species recovery and the affected health and economic interests.

J		Article		Distribution (1986-1999) of Characeae in the Dutch province North Brabant		Bruinsma, John									Systematics and Geography of Plants		2000		70	2	421-427	421	427	English	print					The province North Brabant consists of 5083 km2, between 40 m above and 1.5 m below sea level. Most of the land is in intensive agricultural use. Nature reserves consists of dune sands, heath, moorland pools and woods on very poor soils, bogs, low productive (wet) grasslands, stream valleys and a (former) estuary. There are 845 records of twenty charophyte species from 1986-1999. The majority of records were made in a small transition zone between the Pleistocene sand and loam area and the river and sea clay areas. Also the larger number of species (17) was found here. In the transition zone water quality varies considerably, due to the presence of seepage water of various age and origin. Some species are common to the Pleistocene area and the transition zone, others are common to the transition zone and both clay areas. At the loamy part of the Pleistocene area some species occur that grow in the transition zone and in the river clay area as well. In the dug off moor charophytes are only found at the edges of the area. In the former estuary, now a brackish lake, some species preferring slightly brackish to brackish water were found. Quite often charophytes are ephemeral, more so in shallow, eutrophic, and standing water, less so in opposite conditions. Charophytes are not protected by law. They may profit from conservation of rich sites and from nature improvement measures like digging pools for amphibians, restoration of moorland pools and removal of fertilised top soil. Charophytes may suffer from measures that have side effects such as reduction of surface water or deterioration of water quality.

J		Article		Spatial and temporal distribution of dominant epiphytes on Gracilaria from a natural subtidal bed in central-southern Chile		Gonzalez, Mariela A.; Barrales, Hugo L.; Candia, Arturo; Cid, Luis									Aquaculture		1993		116	2-3	135-148	135	148	English						Data are presented on the taxonomy and the temporal and spatial distribution of the most prevalent epiphytic taxa in a natural subtidal bed of Gracilaria in central-southern Chile. Also, the nature of the epiphyte/basiphyte interface is described. Samples were collected from April 1989 to July 1990 from 2.4 to 8.7 m. The following taxa were identified: Ceramium pacificum (Coll.) Kyl., Ceramium sp., Nitophyllum peruvianum (Mont.) Howe, Callophyllis variegata (Bory) Kuetz., Callophyllis pinnata Setch. and Swezy, Rhodophyllis aff. Acanthocarpa (Harv.) J. Ag., Plocamium cartilagineum (L.) Dix., Antithamnionella sp. and Ulva lobata (Kuetz.) Setch and Gardner. Epiphytism was seasonal; biomass maxima were recorded during the spring and summer from a depth of 6.2 m down. Except for Ulva, epiphyte biomass varied significantly (P ltoreq 0.01) with seasons, depths and their interactions. The two species of Ceramium posed the most serious problem because of their widespread occurrence, both seasonally and bathymetrically, and their high biomass, particularly in the bathymetric range in which Gracilaria is harvested. Additionally, profuse epiphytism by three taxa of red foliose algae Nitophyllum, Rhodophyllis and Callophyllis, was recorded at depths between 7.5 to 8.7 m. However, in spite of the fact that in summer their biomass was significantly higher (P lt 0.01) than that of Ceramium, they were of lesser concern because they colonize Gracilaria below the harvestable range of the bed. Damage caused by epiphytes might be a consequence of increased algal drag (by red folioses and Ulva) and weakening of the thalli of Gracilaria by penetration of rhizoids (by Ceramium spp.).

J		Article		[Tree-dwelling lichens of the "Witwald" oak forest of Wildenstein.]	Die baumflechten des eichenwitwaldes von Wildenstein.	Frei, Martin									Mitteilungen der Naturforschenden Gesellschaften beider Basel		2003		7		157-171	157	171	German	print					More than 200 tree-dwelling lichens have been identified during research in Wildenstein Nature Reserve. This corresponds to about a third of all established varieties that have been reported in Switzerland up to now. 140 varieties were discovered on the knotty, partly over 500-year-old oak trees alone, among them many typical oak and old tree residents. 16% of the varieties found are on the Swiss Red List, 57% are considered endangered in the Jura mountains. An additional 16% (Switzerland) or 19% (Jura) are counted amoung the IUCN category NT (near threatened). Several varieties find their greatest known incidence in Switzerland. Two lichen varieties are federally protected (Gyalecta ulmi, Parmotrema stuppeum). Some of the varieties have only been described recently or are still awaiting a scientific description. The by far richest varieties of lichen vegetation can be found on free-standing oaks or those in sparsely wooded areas. This is primarily due to a cultivation that has been more or less the same for centuries, to the diverse ages of the trees, and to the extensive under-exploitation. In the remaining nature reserve the incidence of rare lichens is concentrated in the relatively humid locations near ditches and small valleys of brooks. The most important measures to protect lichens relate to the sustained maintenance and growing of loosely planted oak populations with diverse generations of trees and the protection of oak trunks from encroaching undergrowth.

J		Article		Voluntary intake and gastric digestion of two hays by llamas and sheep: Influence of concentrate supplementation		Lemosquet, S.; Dardillat, C.; Jailler, M.; Dulphy, J. P.									Journal of Agricultural Science		1996		127	4	539-548	539	548	English						The efficiency with which llamas and sheep digest various roughages was compared in France in 1993. Six llamas (three of which were rumen-cannulated) and six rumen-cannulated sheep were simultaneously given three different diets: (i) a grass hay low in N content (HLN), (ii) the same hay with barley, representing 25% of the total dry matter (HLN + B) and (iii) a cocksfoot grass hay, rich in nitrogen (HRN). Daily forage dry matter intake was slightly, but not significantly, lower in llamas (55.9 g/kg W-0.75 v. 60.3 g/kg W-0.75 in sheep). Intake behaviour was similar for the two species except that the number of rumination periods was lower with llamas (P lt 0.05). With all diets, the digestibility of both organic matter and cell walls (estimated from neutral detergent fibre) was higher in llamas (+5.6 and +6.5 units respectively, P lt 0.001). The higher digestibility in llamas may be related to the slightly lower level of intake and to the lower dry matter turnover rate in the forestomachs compared to sheep (3.9%/h v. 5.3%/h, P lt 0.01). However, in sacco degradation of both hays were higher in llamas' forestomachs after 24 h of incubation (+6.5%, P lt 0.01) and 48 h (+4.3%, P lt 0.05) than in sheep. The high microbial efficiency of the llamas can be ascribed to the physical and chemical characteristics of their forestomach contents, which had a higher liquid turnover rate (+1.4%/h, P lt 0.05), a lower volatile fatty acid concentration (P lt 0.01), a higher and more constant pH (P lt 0.01) than in sheep and a greater buffering capacity when pH was close to neutral. These results suggest the greater ability of llamas to control the physicochemical conditions of their forestomach contents to digest cell walls efficiently and to minimize the negative effects of concentrate supplementation.

J		Article		A UK perspective on intensive hatchery rearing methods for Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus L.)		Shields, Robin J.; Gara, Brendan; Gillespie, Malcolm J.S.									Aquaculture		1999	June 1, 1999	176	1-2	15-25	15	25	English	print					A review is presented of UK hatchery rearing techniques for Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus L.), based on research findings and commercial practices. Operations from gamete collection through to weaning are covered, including reference to survival rates at each developmental phase. Areas of recent progress are discussed in relation to the remaining production bottlenecks and research requirements. Rearing techniques have been shaped to a large extent by the temperate water conditions prevailing at UK hatcheries. The requirement of halibut broodstocks and eggs/yolk sac larvae for cold, stable water conditions has placed an emphasis on intensive hatchery systems that incorporate accurate temperature control mechanisms. The energy costs associated with chilling are reduced by the use of low water flow rates and water recycling, where possible. Yolk sac larvae are reared in smaller tanks (500-2000 1 volume) than conventional Norwegian-style 'silos'. Configuration and husbandry procedures for this developmental stage have been modified accordingly, including early transfer of the yolk sac larvae to feeding tanks (at around 150-180 degree days post-hatch). The live feeding phase is mostly carried out indoors under artificial lighting. Feeding is typically initiated at an age of 220-250 degree days post-hatch. Brine shrimp, Artemia sp., constitute the basis of the diet in most cases, with the exception of one commercial hatchery engaged in large scale copepod production. Recent research on this phase has focused on defining Artemia enrichment protocols and methods of diet presentation, with the aim of improving the survival and growth rates of larvae, and their metamorphosis attributes. Crumbled feeds are used to wean halibut juveniles onto formulated diets. Recent improvements in hatchery survival rates, combined with greater egg availability, have enabled UK production capacity to rise to hundreds-of-thousands of juveniles per year using existing commercial facilities. Operators have identified the transition from late yolk sac phase to onset of feeding as the primary hurdle remaining in the hatchery rearing process and this is the subject of ongoing research into physical environmental conditions, handling methods and microbial conditions in the rearing tanks.

An epidemiological and environmental approach was used to check the security for the exposed populations (surrounding and agricultural population in Clermont-Ferrand. Four information systems were set up: two sentinel systems joining general physicians (15) and pharmacists (7) for the surrounding population and two follow-up surveys among field workers and farmers. Water quality monitoring and a study of aerosols from spray irrigation were performed. No epidemic event was identified with only some case clusters (not related to water exposure) being observed. All the declared cases were benign. The workers' survey underlined a substantial incidence of nettle rashes, itchy skins, sunburns, and cuts. The follow-up study among farmers and their families did not reveal any particular phenomena. The bacteriological quality of treated wastewater throughout conformed with the recommendations of the Superior Council of Public Health of France (1,000 faecal coliforms/100 mL). No faecal bacteria were observed in aerosols with water concentrations equal to 103 cfu/100mL and an exposure time of 20 min. The survey of such an irrigation system, towards potential and actual risks, required the conjunction of different epidemiological information sources and microbiological data.

J		Article		Phytoplankton changes in a shallow Mediterranean lake (Albufera of Valencia, Spain) after sewage diversion.		Villena, Maria-Jose (mjvillen@uv.es) ; Romo, Susana (Susana.Romo@uv.es)									Hydrobiologia		2003	15 November, 2003	506-509		281-287	281	287	English	print					Phytoplankton from Lake Albufera, a shallow, polimictic, freshwater lake, was studied before and after sewage diversion. The lake is used as a reservoir for rice cultivation in the surrounding lake area. Due to antropogenic eutrophication in the 1960s, the lake turned from a mesotrophic to a hypertrophic, turbid state. In 1991, a restoration plan of the lake started which has reduced 30% of sewage effluents. Total phosphorus in the lake was reduced about 31%, from 0.49 to 0.34 mg l-1, but nitrate did not vary. Chlorophyll-a mean annual values diminished to half, although hypertrophic levels remained (mean value from 318 mug l-1 to 180 mug l-1). The algal community structure indicates a response to P reduction in the direction of increasing equal contribution of algal groups. Cyanobacteria are still the dominant group, but reduced their biomass by about 15%, due to filamentous cyanobacteria depletion (from 78% to 48% of total phytoplankton biovolume), in favour of chroococcal cyanobacteria (changed from 7 to 23% in the 1990s). Other algal groups, especially diatoms and chlorophytes, also increased their contribution in the phytoplankton after nutrient diversion, while euglenophytes, indicative of organic matter pollution in the lake, decreased. There were pronounced changes in phytoplankton composition and a general trend toward presence of smaller algal species. The dominant species in biovolume during the 1980s, Planktothrix agardhii, almost disappeared in the lake in the 1990s, and was replaced seasonally by the slender Pseudanabaena galeata. Disappearance of Planktothrix agardhii, allowed large Cladocera to control algae early in the year (dominant small diatoms and chlorophytes), during several clear water phases occurring in recent years that lasted up to five weeks. Even though some improvement of the lake water quality was observed, complementary restoration measures are suggested, such as a reduction of phosphorus below 0.05 mg l-1, control of pesticides in the catchment area, and management of benthivorous-planktivorous fish species, in order to re-establish phytoplankton composition and submerged plants as at the beginning of the 20th century.

J	11759753	Article		The occurrence of enteric pathogens and Aeromonas species in organic vegetables		McMahon, M. A. S.; Wilson, I. G.									International Journal of Food Microbiology		2001	22 October, 2001	70	1-2	155-162	155	162	English	print					A range of commercially available organic vegetables (n=86) was examined for the presence of Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, E. coli O 157, Listeria and Aeromonas spp., to provide information on the occurrence of such organisms in organic vegetables in Northern Ireland. The study was not designed to quantify such organisms or to compare occurrence with conventionally farmed vegetables. Standard enrichment techniques were used to isolate and identify enteric pathogens and Aeromonas species. No Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli, E. coli O 157, Listeria were found in any of the samples examined. Aeromonas species were isolated from 34% of the total number of organic vegetables examined. Many (64%) of the organic vegetables examined were "ready-to-eat" after minimal processing, i.e., washing. Aeromonas spp. was isolated from 41% of these vegetables. Aeromonas spp. was not recovered from certain vegetable types. The most commonly isolated species of Aeromonas was Aeromonas schubertii with 21.0% of all samples contaminated with this species; 5.8% of samples contained A. hydrophila, 5.8% A. trota, 3.5% A. caviae and 2.3% contained A. veronii biovar veronii. Although Aeromonas species are frequently detected in organic vegetables, the absence of accepted enteric pathogens was encouraging, and does not support the allegation of organic foods being of high risk due to the farming methods used.

Sporadic cases in the developed world are mainly imported via immigrants and travellers from endemic areas. HEV has been suggested to be a zoonotic infection where pigs may be an important reservoir for the disease and specific swine strains of HEV have been identified which can infect also humans. The aim of this study was to analyse if Swedish pig farmers are more exposed to HEV than persons with other occupations. A total of 115 male pig farmers aged 40-60 y and 108 age- and geographically-matched control subjects were tested for IgG anti-HEV antibodies. No statistical difference in anti-HEV prevalence was noted between pig farmers (13.0%) and control subjects (9.3%). The prevalence of anti-HEV antibodies in the pig farmers and controls was higher than that previously reported among other populations in Europe (< 1-9%). Further studies are needed to elucidate the routes for infection of indigenous HEV and if sub-clinical infections with pig associated HEV strains occur in Sweden.

Historically, "animal control" for local elimination of disease was largely equated with population reduction. However, with relatively few exceptions, culling alone has not led to effective control of rabies. In most documented examples of effective control of rabies in the 20th century; an integrated management approach was used that included public education, responsible stewardship of animal populations, manipulation of the population carrying capacity of the local habitat, and vaccination strategies.Globally, the greatest burden on human health that is attributable to this zoonosis is caused by uncontrolled rabies in dogs. Where political willingness, biomedical infrastructure, and economic stability permit the sustained use of control measures (e.g. stray animal removal and mandatory parenteral vaccination), canine rabies has been significantly suppressed and even eliminated over large geographical areas. Examples include many island nations, most of North America, Europe, and increasingly in South America. Despite the effectiveness of such proven control techniques, however, their implementation in parts of Asia, Africa, and elsewhere has been limited, primarily because of a lack of dedicated resources and intersectoral cooperation, and also because of the burden of high-density populations of dogs. Implementation is often complicated by cultural and social factors, e.g. reluctance to cull apparently ownerless, nuisance animals that are suspected to have been exposed to rabies, partly on the basis of religious beliefs). Attempts to modify animal fertility (such as the encouragement of voluntary spay - neuter programmes or individual chemical contraception, and the extension of such actions to animals in the community) may provide ancillary support in line with other traditional methods of control of canine rabies. With the identification of complex situations in which wildlife rabies persists despite the elimination of canine rabies, e.g. in North America and Europe, cats can pose a significant public health risk requiring consideration of alternative approaches.In any model system, the threat of translocation of infected animals, unintentional or otherwise, provides a strong rationale for the creation of barriers to prevent reintroduction or exacerbation of the disease, and the maintenance of a minimum body of expertise related to surveillance, diagnosis, and the enactment of mitigating measures. While control activities have traditionally focused upon certain Carnivora species, bats represent another worldwide rabies reservoir. Indiscriminate killing of bats and destruction of roosts was once the norm, but such activities are not sanctioned by reputable organizations today. Even vampire bats, responsible for substantial effects on health and agricultural losses in the New World (Mexico to Argentina), should be targeted only by specific control applications, rather than by more widespread, unconventional, non-specific methodology.Bats should be excluded from human living quarters. Implementing measures to prevent bats from gaining access to homes should occur at an appropriate time when the bats are absent, especially to avoid sealing the non-flying young within a building. Although great progress has been made during the past four decades in the induction of herd immunity among free-ranging carnivores via oral vaccination against rabies, similar novel solutions have not been readily applied to bat populations. Given these challenges, new paradigm shifts are eagerly anticipated as additional biotechnological applications (including contraceptives and anticoagulants) are developed to deal with domestic animals and wildlife.

J		Article		History and epizootiology of rabies		Nagy, A.; Kerekes, B.									Magyar Allatorvosok Lapja		1995		50	2	70-77	70	77	Hungarian						History and epizootiological forms (urbanic, sylvatic and bat) have been summarized. In the development of a rabies epizootic, the ecology of wildlife living on the given territory plays also an important part. Importance of immigration (seasonal moving of individuals during the breeding season, in case of the lack of foodstuff, etc.) and succession (of animal species on the same territory, mainly due to the influences of the activities of men on the ecosystem) has also been highlighted. In Europe, 21,044 rabies cases were recorded in 1990. Of them 61% were fox, 9.6% cattle, 6.1% dog, 5.6% cat, 4.1% sheep/goat, 2% deer, 1.3% badger, 0.5% horse cases (Table 1). In Hungary, only the urbanic rabies was present at the beginning of that century. By the end of thirties, as a result of the introduction of the rules for dog keeping and the obligatory immunization of dogs, Hungary (for the first time in the world) became free of urbanic rabies (Figure 1). Nowadays more than 1.5 million dogs are vaccinated against rabies in a year (Figure 2). Immunization of cats is not obligatory but it is advisable. Rabies cases of dogs and cats recorded between 1990 and 1993 are shown in Figs 3 and 4. Stray cats (their number is estimated to approx. 100,000, Table 2) breed without control in the neighborhood of men. Sylvatic rabies appeared in Poland in 1939 and spread Southern and SouthWestern direction with a speed of 30 to 50 km per year. The main reservoir is red fox. The sylvatic rabies was introduced in Hungary in 1954 (Figure 5) and the whole country had become infected by the end of 1971. The trend of epizootic shows a direct correlation with the size of fox population. At first, conventional methods (gassing of fox burrows by phosgene candles) were used to reduce the number of foxes. These methods proved to be unsuccessful, as all over the world. (Size of the fox population is determined by the supporter conditions of a given territory.) Thus, the reduction of fox population was suspended in Hungary in 1987. The pick of the yearly epidemic curve falls on the first three months of the year owing to the mating period. The bottom of the curve falls on the summer season while it increases again in autumn. owing to the scattering of growing foxes (Figs 6 and 7). The infection of domestic animals is always connected to the epizootics in wildlife. In Hungary, all the domestic and farm animal rabies cases can be traced back to a rabid fox contact. Fox shows a territorial behaviour, however the hunting areas often cover each other. Defense of the own hunting area (which is characteristic only for males) may lead to fighting (biting). Their individual territory is 15 to 35 km-2. Young foxes search for new living space from September-October because they become food-concurrent of their parents and partners. They wander 8 to 25 km, on an average. Rabies is also present in smaller fox populations, however an epidemic does not develop. In densely populated areas it should be reckon with the urbanization of foxes (rubbish-shoots, refuse bins). In Hungary, the number of diagnosed rabies cases per year is around thousand. Of them, the ratio of foxes is the highest, however the number of fox cases decreases gradually (Figs 8 to 14). Figs 15 and 16 show the number of diagnosed rabies cases according to counties in Hungary, in the first, second and third quarters, as well as in October, 1994. Without any adequate basic immunity, as well as postexpositional, serial vaccination, 20% of the infected men develop rabies.

Aster cultivar of potato was cultivated in two systems: conventional and ecological. The microbiological analysis showed that the coryneform group dominated over other investigated groups of bacteria. The greatest number of bacteria was isolated from rhizoplane of potatoes cultivated in ecological system. The results obtained during three years of the experiment show that the number of potentially antagonistic bacteria increased along with plant vegetation.

Wint., is an important disease in commercial apple production. A mapping population of 155 individuals, derived from a cross between the apple varieties 'Prima' (resistant) X 'Fiesta' (susceptible), was scored for response to the disease in replicated field and glasshouse trials throughout Europe. Twenty data sets were selected and cluster analysis was used to form a consensus score for the population fitting a 1:1 segregation ratio of resistance:susceptibility. The progeny were scored with molecular markers. A detailed map covering 54 cM of the 'Prima' linkage group containing the Vf gene for scab resistance was constructed using 24 molecular markers linked to the resistance gene. One isoenzyme marker (Pgm-1), six RFLP markers and 17 RAPD markers formed a linkage group with the consensus measure of resistance to scab. Four marker bridges were established with the corresponding 'Fiesta' linkage group with additional markers (one isozyme, one RFLP, three RAPD and one AFLP). A low chi-square value indicated a good fit of the marker ordering, which was in close agreement with previously reported linkage positions for some of the markers and Vf. Differences were observed in the ability of different scoring methods to resolve susceptible and resistant classes. The results obtained for the consensus classification of resistance to scab for the population may suggest the presence of virulent inocula at some sites, which could overcome the Vf gene for resistance. The consequences of relying on individual scoring occasions for studying Vf scab resistance are discussed in the context of linkage analysis, conventional breeding selection, and marker-assisted selection.

Revue Scientifique et Technique Office International des Epizooties		2002	August, 2002	21	2	287-303	287	303	English	print					Classical swine fever (CSF) is of increasing concern in Europe where wild boar appear to play an important epidemiological role. In most parts of the continent, demographic trends are on the increase, due to improvement in game management. As a result of higher densities, populations become more susceptible to various infectious diseases, among which CSF is cause for particular concern. Wild boar do not appear to be a classic reservoir in most cases, but nevertheless may perpetuate foci of infection over the long term, constituting a real threat for the pig farming industry. Since the infection does not appear to spread easily in natural populations of free-ranging wild boars, control of the disease may be feasible. However, most of the appropriate measures, such as banning hunting, are not considered acceptable. Consequently, the expertise of wildlife disease specialists is required to help solve the problem when it occurs.

On a voluntary basis, 559 patients were reported to the registry. Most cases originated from rural communities in regions from eastern France to western Austria; single cases were reported far away from the disease-"endemic" zone throughout central Europe. Of 210 patients, 61.4% were involved in vocational or part-time farming, gardening, forestry, or hunting. Patients were diagnosed at a mean age of 52.5 years; 78% had symptoms. Alveolar echinococcosis primarily manifested as a liver disease. Of the 559 patients, 190 (34%) were already affected by spread of the parasitic larval tissue. Of 408 (73%) patients alive in 2000, 4.9% were cured. The increasing prevalence of Echinococcus multilocularis in foxes in rural and urban areas of central Europe and the occurrence of cases outside the alveolar echinococcosis-endemic regions suggest that this disease deserves increased attention.

J		Article		Sediment mineralization, nutrient fluxes, denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium in an estuarine fjord with sea cage trout farms		Christensen, Peter Bondo; Rysgaard, Soren; Sloth, Niels Peter; Dalsgaard, Tage; Schwaerter, Steen									Aquatic Microbial Ecology		2000	Feb. 21, 2000	21	1	73-84	73	84	English	print					Sediment oxygen consumption, nutrient fluxes across the sediment-water interface, denitrification, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) were measured in sediment below the cages of a rainbow trout farm in the estuary of Horsens Fjord, Denmark, and compared to that in the sediment at reference stations elsewhere in the fjord. Denitrification and DNRA were measured by the isotope pairing technique and a 15N technique, respectively. The measurements are the first published data of in situ activities in sediment below marine fish farms. Oxygen consumption by the sediment and effluxes of NH4+ and PO43- were markedly stimulated by organic matter loading from the overlying fish cages. Denitrification of nitrate from the water column (Dw) was only of significance during autumn and winter when runoff from land resulted in high water column nitrate concentrations. In contrast, coupled nitrification-denitrification (Dn) occurred in the sediment throughout the summer, with the rates in the sediment below the fish cages surprisingly being of the same magnitude as those at the reference stations. Competition for inorganic nitrogen from benthic microalgae probably inhibited the activity of both nitrifiers and denitrifiers at the reference stations, while a mat of Beggiatoa spp. on the sediment surface below the fish cages in late summer indicated the presence of sulfide in the uppermost layers of the sediment, which almost ceased Dn. While DNRA was absent in sediment unaffected by the trout farms, it was of quantitative importance in the reduced sediment below the fish cages, DNRA activity being up to 7-fold greater than denitrification activity. The ecological consequence of this shift in the relative importance of the processes in response to organic matter loading was a reduced nitrogen removal by denitrification and an increased efflux of NH4+ to the water column, resulting in stimulation of pelagic primary production and increased nitrogen retention by the ecosystem. The excess nitrogen input to the fjord from the trout farms corresponded to approximately 12% of the total nitrogen load from land during the summer months. Only 0.1% of this additional nitrogen input was removed by denitrification in the underlying sediments during the fish production season. In general, shallow estuarine ecosystems hosting fish farms may therefore face increasing eutrophication problems due to the direct supply of nutrients in the fish food and to shifts in the dominant microbial processes in the sediment below the fish cages.

J		Article		Soil organic matter and microbial community structure in set-aside and intensively managed arable soils in NE-Saxony, Germany		Hamer, Ute (hamer@forst.tu-dresden.de) ; MakesChin, Franz; Stadler, Jutta; Klotz, Stefan									Applied Soil Ecology		2008	NOV 2008	40	3	465-475	465	475	English						The effects of set-aside and intensive management of agricultural soils on soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (N) mineralisation rates (gross and net rates), microbial biomass (chloroform-fumigation extraction method) and microbial community structure (phospholipid fatty acid analysis, PLFA) were assessed during one growing season (June and September). A former arable soil which has been set-aside as fallow with natural succession vegetation ("fallow land") was compared to a soil under intensive agricultural management ("intensive") with site conditions typical of NE-Saxony, Germany. The soil type was a sandy Cambisol. Six years of intensive agricultural management significantly decreased SOC and TN contents as well as pH and increased NO3-N contents in the topsoil (0-10 cm) compared to fallow soil. As indicated by higher gross N mineralisation rates, the potential to deliver N increased during the fallow period. However, the substrate use efficiency of microorganisms and the turnover of the microbial biomass were higher in the intensively managed soil. Independent of management system SOC mineralisation, net N mineralisation, gross NH4 consumption and gross NO3 transformation rates increased with increasing water content from June to September. Principal component analysis of PLFA data indicated differences in the microbial community composition between the sites. However, in total the soil microbial community was more stable against land-use changes than against seasonal changes. The PLFA profiles of both sites changed into the same direction from June to September. Only the relative abundances of PLFA marker characteristic of Gram(-) bacteria and fungi showed a site x time interaction as did the MBC/MBN ratio and the MBN content. In total, the influence of land-use on most examined parameters of the sandy Cambisol was less pronounced than seasonal changes. Therefore, set-aside and taking set-aside land back into intensive agricultural production seem to be a reasonable management practice for sites on sandy Cambisols in NE-Saxony, Germany.

J		Article		Release of transgenic bacterial inoculants - rhizobia as a case study		Hirsch, Penny R. (penny.hirsch@bbsrc.ac.uk)									Plant and Soil		2004	October 2004	266	1-2	1-10	1	10	English	print					The current debate on the release of genetically modified organisms to the environment must be informed by scientific data obtained from field studies. Many of the microorganisms that have potential applications outside the laboratory, especially in agriculture and horticulture, could be improved by genetic modification. Rhizobia, the bacteria that form N2-fixing symbioses with leguminous plants, have a long history of safe use as seed inoculants, their biology is relatively well known, and they represent a relevant model system. There have been several field releases of genetically modified (GM) rhizobia in the USA and Europe, which provide information on various aspects of their ecology and efficacy. This review summarises the rationale for each release, details of the methods used for monitoring, and the results. Novel properties of rhizobia did not always have the predicted effects. Most studies revealed that rhizobial numbers dropped rapidly after application to soil or seeds but then numbers stabilised for months or years. The monitoring of survival and spread of rhizobia was greatly improved by the presence of novel marker genes. Tagging of rhizobia with marker genes provided more accurate information compared to the use of conventional strains, illustrating an important application of genetic modification, for tracking bacteria in the environment.

J		Article		Early sowing: A reduced tillage system for spring sowing: Final report for field experiments 1992-1996		Arvidsson, Johan									Sveriges Lantbruksuniversitet Uppsala Institutionen for Markvetenskap Rapporter fran Jordbearbetningsavdelningen		1997		0	92	1-45	1	45	Swedish	print					In this report, "early sowing" implies a reduced tillage system for spring sowing. The sowing is done early in the year without any previous tillage operation in the spring. Traditional seedbed preparation in Sweden includes 3-4 harrowings followed by sowing. Since the soil is normally at field capacity after winter, this system implies a major risk of soil compaction, and the farmer has to wait for the soil to dry before seedbed preparation can be started. Early sowing of spring cereals without harrowing is a technique that has been made possible by new types of sowing machines and improved tyre equipment. In the years 1988 to 1996 the method was tested in a large number of field experiments throughout Sweden. The primary objective was to study the impact on yield in different regions and on different soil types. The interaction between early sowing and other management practices, such as primary tillage, was also tested. The results can be summarized in the following conclusions: - Early sowing reduces the cost of tillage and increases the yield potential by lengthening the vegetation period. - In 70 field experiments, sowing at first possible occasion on average increased yield by 1 percent compared to conventional sowing. - Early sowing increased yield on sandy soils in Halland, but decreased yield in Norr- and Vasterbotten. - On till soils in Skane and on heavy clay soils in the central parts of Sweden, crop yield was on aver-age the same for early and conventional sowing. Especially on clay soils there was a large yield variation in individual trials. Early sowing should not be used on soils with great risks of crusting. Soil compaction was not significantly different between early and conventional sowing in four long term experiments on different soil types. Plant establishment was generally somewhat poorer for early than for conventional sowing. For the earliest sowing there was no correlation between plant establishment and crop yield relative to conventional sowing. The interaction between sowing practice and seeding rate on crop yield was studied in 22 experiments. The same seeding rate can be recommended for conventional and early sowing. There were only small interactions between sowing and primary tillage practice. Cereals, especially oats, were suited for early sowing. Oilseed rape seemed more sensitive to low temperature and should not be sown very early. In one experiment, there was a higher occurrence of fungal pathogens in the early sown crop.

Aquaculture		1995		133	3-4	341-344	341	344	English						A systemic infection of Loma salmonae is described from a farmed rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum, population reared in fresh water in Scotland. Intact xenomas were associated with the blood vessels and pillar system of the gill lamellae and other organs. The secondary gill lamellae were hyperplastic with little evidence of fibrosis or inflammatory infiltrate. Uninucleate oval spores characteristic of L. salmonae are described. A low mortality was attributed to this outbreak which is believed to be the first occurrence in Scotland.	Bruno, David W.; Scottish Office Agric.

The potential agronomic use of pig residues is a high-priority issue for the Guadalentin Valley. This paper reports on the first year of application of PS for broccoli and watermelon plantations, carried out between February to May and April to August, 2002.The influence of the PS on the physical-chemical characteristics of the soil and on watermelon production in the first year of experimentation was much less than for broccoli. The nitrate content was slightly higher in plots without PS application but below the threshold levels established by Decreto 61/2002.In general, the microbial biomass of the soil was greater in the surface 0-30 cm as compared to subsoil (30-60 cm) before the application of the pig slurries for both crops. Bacteria and coliforms increased with depth, while actinomycetes and fungi have not undergone any remarkable changes.

J		Article		Biological control of Lygus spp.: A component of areawide management		Ruberson, John R.; Williams, Livy H., III									Southwestern Entomologist Supplement		2000	September, 2000		23	96-110	96	110	English	print					Lygus spp. are attacked by a variety of predators, parasitoids, and pathogens in the United States, but the overall impact of this natural enemy complex on Lygus populations is not well known. Although nymphal and adult parasitism have been characterized in a number of studies, egg parasitism and the impact of predation are still not well delineated. Several studies indicate that some native predators and parasitoids can inflict high mortality on Lygus populations; however, efficacy of these natural enemies appears to vary among the bugs' host plants, with crop systems experiencing some of the poorest biological control. The fungal pathogen Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) may have potential for managing early-season populations of Lygus spp. in crop systems, but its role at present is quite limited. More information is needed on the role of native natural enemies in the population dynamics of Lygus spp., in both crop and natural systems. This information may help us develop programs using native natural enemies, through either releases or conservation, to target and suppress Lygus populations over large areas and before they enter crop systems. In addition to native natural enemies, there are opportunities for enhancing biological control of Lygus spp. through importation of exotic natural enemies. Although neither the tarnished plant bug (TPB) (Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beauvois)) nor the western tarnished plant bug (WTPB) (Lygus hesperus Knight) occur in Europe, there are several promising parasitoids of congeneric mirids in Europe which exhibit good host specificity, and appear to be good candidates for importation. Several species of European parasitoids have been introduced into the United States, one of which (Peristenus digoneutis Loan) is now established in 7 states of the northeastern U.S., but has failed to establish below 40degreeN latitude. Continuing efforts should be directed toward importing exotic, effective natural enemies that can provide permanent population suppression, as well as the development of habitats that are conducive to survival and reproduction of Lygus natural enemies, whether resident or introduced. These approaches provide opportunities to extend suppression of Lygus populations well beyond the crop system.

J		Article		Diagnosing avian influenza in the framework of wildlife surveillance efforts and environmental samples		Cattoli, G. (gcattoli@izsvenezie.it) ; Capua, I.									Journal of Wildlife Diseases		2007	JUL 2007	43	3, Suppl. S	S35-S39	S35	S39	English						Prior to the ongoing Asian H5N1 epizootic, it was believed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was a disease of domesticated birds and that wild birds could act on ly as reservoirs for the low pathogenic form (LPAI) of these viruses. The unprecedented situation in Asia during 2004 and 2005 revealed spillover of HPAI H5N1 infection to naive populations of wild birds. To date the role wild birds may play in the ecology and epizootiology of HPAI H5NI appears very different to that in other HPAI epizootics, and is far from being completely understood. Recent outbreaks in Russia and Central Asia, Europe, and Africa indicate transboundary spread of HPAI H5N1. Isolation of the virus from wild birds in Eurasia led to speculation that wild birds may play a role in introducing and possibly seconclarily spreading the infection to disease-free areas. Several diagnostic methodologies are available to detect avian influenza infection. Generation of reliable data requires the most appropriate diagnostic approach specific to the aim of the surveillance program and ecology of the virus in both the target population and the environment. Harmonized diagnostic strategies for detection of HPAI H5N1. must be developed and followed worldwide in order to make results comparable and useful to the international scientific community. The OIE/FAO Reference Laboratory in Padova, Italy is involved in extensive surveillance of wild birds sampled in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. Using results of this program, we developed a set of diagnostic guidelines that could be a basis for a harmonized approach by diagnostic laboratories.

J		Article		Fungal biomass in pastures increases with age and reduced N input		de Vries, Franciska T. (Franciska.devries@wur.nl) ; Bloem, Jaap; van Eekeren, Nick; Brusaard, Lijbert; Hoffland, Ellis									Soil Biology & Biochemistry		2007	JUL 2007	39	7	1620-1630	1620	1630	English						Previous studies have shown that soil fungal biomass increases towards more natural, mature systems. Shifts to a fungal-based soil food web have previously been observed with abandonment of agricultural fields and extensification of agriculture. In a previous field experiment we found increased fungal biomass with reduced N fertilisation. Here, we explore relationships between fungi, bacteria, N input and grassland age on real dairy farms in the Netherlands. We hypothesised that also in pastures that are still in production there is a negative relationship between fungal biomass and fertilisation, and that fungal biomass increases with grassland age in pastures that are still in production. We expected the fungal/bacterial biomass ratio to show the same responses, as this ratio has often been used as an indicator for management changes. We sampled 48 pastures from eight organic dairy farms. Sites differed in age and fertilisation rate. We determined fungal and bacterial biomass, as well as ergosterol (a fungal biomarker). Fungal and bacterial biomass and ergosterol, showed a negative relationship with N application rate, and correlated positively with organic matter percentage. In old pastures, fungal biomass and ergosterol were higher than in younger pastures. Because bacterial biomass responded in the same way as fungal biomass, the F/B ratio remained constant, and can therefore-in our data set-not be used as an indicator for changing management. We conclude that the changes in fungal and bacterial biomass were driven by changes in organic matter quality and quantity. The negative relationship we found between N application rate and fungal biomass adds to earlier work and confirms the presence of this relationship in pastures with relatively small differences in management intensities. Earlier studies on shifts in fungal biomass focused on ex-agricultural fields or restoration projects. Here we show that fungal biomass is also higher in older agricultural pastures.

J		Article		Griffon vulture Gyps fulvus food shortages in the Ebro Valley (NE Spain) caused by regulations against bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)		Camina, Alvaro (acamia@vodafone.es) ; Montelio, Eugenio									Acta Ornithologica (Warsaw)		2006	SUM 2006	41	1	7-13	7	13	English						Livestock farms in the mid-Ebro Valley were regularly monitored for carcass disposal and food availability before and after the carcass removal programme was established. At the same time Griffon Vulture censuses were carried out. During 2004 vultures fed almost exclusively on pigs. Since 2005 carcasses have not been available for vultures, but griffon numbers using the area have remained roughly the same. Most of the vultures previously present were nonbreeding birds, which probably increased their chances of survival by feeding far from the breeding colonies. Since the inception of the carcass removal programme, the situation has reversed, with adults now outnumbering immature birds. The establishment of carcass removal programmes all over Spain could affect the stability and future evolution of Griffon Vulture populations. To ensure a proper conservation policy for vulture species, scientific research is urgently needed in other areas before management measures are implemented.

J	10811570	Article		Assessing potential health risks from microcystin toxins in blue-green algae dietary supplements		Gilroy, Duncan J.; Kauffman, Kenneth W.; Hall, Ronald A.; Huang, Xuan; Chu, Fun S.									Environmental Health Perspectives		2000	May, 2000	108	5	435-439	435	439	English	print					The presence of blue-green algae (BGA) toxins in surface waters used for drinking water sources and recreation is receiving increasing attention around the world as a public health concern. However, potential risks from exposure to these toxins in contaminated health food products that contain BGA have been largely ignored. BGA products are commonly consumed in the United States, Canada, and Europe for their putative beneficial effects, including increased energy and elevated mood. Many of these products contain Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, a BGA that is harvested from Upper Klamath Lake (UKL) in southern Oregon, where the growth of a toxic BGA, Microcystis aeruginosa, is a regular occurrence. M. aeruginosa produces compounds called microcystins, which are potent hepatotoxins and probable tumor promoters. Because M. aeruginosa coexists with A. flos-aquae, it can be collected inadvertently during the harvesting process, resulting in microcystin contamination of BGA products. In fall 1996, the Oregon Health Division learned that UKL was experiencing an extensive M. aeruginosa bloom, and an advisory was issued recommending against water contact. The advisory prompted calls from consumers of BGA products, who expressed concern about possible contamination of these products with microcystins. In response, the Oregon Health Division and the Oregon Department of Agriculture established a regulatory limit of 1 mug/g for microcystins in BGA-containing products and tested BGA products for the presence of microcystins. Microcystins were detected in 85 of 87 samples tested, with 63 samples (72%) containing concentrations > 1 mug/g. HPLC and ELISA tentatively identified microcystin-LR, the most toxic microcystin variant, as the predominant congener.

Although the pig farming industry is flourishing in Taiwan, reports of S. suis infection remain rare. We report 2 cases of S. suis meningitis successfully treated with ceftriaxone and penicillin. Previous reports of S. suis infection from the English literature are reviewed and the clinical data of cases reported in Asian and European countries are summarized. In Europe, there was good correlation between clinical disease and porcine contact, while few cases in Asia reported this association. Meningitis remained the most common presentation of infection in both areas (84.6% and 75.2%, respectively), followed by sepsis (15.4% and 18.6%, respectively), which had a higher mortality rate, particularly for splenectomized patients. Other clinical presentations included enteritis, arthritis, endocarditis, pneumonia, spondylodiscitis, endophthalmitis, uveitis and peritonitis. Deafness was a distinct sequelae (50.5% in Europe and 51.9% in Asia) after recovery from S. suis infection, especially in patients with meningitis. Not all commercial identification systems for streptpcocci could offer adequate speciation for S. suis. When viridans group streptococci are isolated from patients with meningitis and sepsis, prompt and correct identification of isolates to the species level should be performed, especially in areas with a high prevalence of S. suis diseases.

(bill.cormack@adas.co.uk)									Biological Agriculture & Horticulture		2006		24	1	1-20	1	20	English						In stockless organic crop rotations, the absence of livestock, manures and long-term grass/clover leys pose significant agronomic challenges. A study in eastern England, from 1990 to 2000, on a productive silty clay loam soil previously in an intensive non-organic arable rotation, assessed crop performance in a stockless arable organic rotation. Performance of fertility building crops was very variable; establishment was affected by a range of environmental and other factors. However, this was not clearly reflected in the performance of following arable crops illustrating the over-riding impact of environmental conditions on organic crop performance, particularly on a fertile soil. Over the first full crop rotation, mean yields of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) (7.3 t ha(-1)), spring wheat (Triticum aestivum) (4.1 t ha(-1)) and spring beans (Viciafaba) (3.6 t ha(-1)) were all above average for organic production in the U.K.. Foliar disease levels in combinable crops were generally very low. Damage from slugs (Deroceras reticulatum) and blight (Phytophthora infestans) contributed to very variable potato (Solanum tuberosum) yields (14.7 to 40.2 t ha(-1)). Soil available P and K tended to decline slowly with time but remained above levels likely to restrict crop growth.	Cormack, W.

Epidemiology and Infection		2004	April 2004	132	2	317-325	317	325	English	print					Campylobacter sp. is the most common cause of acute bacteria) gastroenteritis in Sweden and the incidence has been increasing. Case-control studies to identify risk factors have been conducted in several countries, but much remains unexplained. The geographical distribution of campylobacter infections varies substantially, and many environmental factors may influence the observed pattern. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) offer an opportunity to use routinely available surveillance data to explore associations between potential environmental risk factors showing a geographical pattern and disease incidence, complementing traditional approaches for investigating risk factors for disease. We investigated associations between campylobacter incidence and environmental factors related to water and livestock in Sweden. Poisson regression was used to estimate the strength of the associations. Positive associations were found between campylobacter incidence and average water-pipe length per person, ruminant density, and a negative association with the percentage of the population receiving water from a public water supply. This indicates that drinking water and contamination from livestock may be important factors in explaining sporadic human campylobacteriosis in Sweden, and that contamination occurring in the water distribution system might be more important than previously considered.

It creates a wide breadth of positive environmental impacts because it reduces emissions of greenhouse gases, improves the management of manure and organic wastes, and replaces mineral fertilizer. Biogas is used today mainly for electricity and heat production, but it can also be applied as a vehicle fuel or for the production of hydrogen which is necessary for fuel cells. Biogas production in the agricultural sector is a very fast growing market in many European countries. This paper presents the current situation in Germany which has the highest number of agricultural biogas plants in Europe.

J		Article		The question of metalaxyl resistance on late blight fungus in Estonia		Runno, E. (Eve.Runno@jpbi.ee) ; Koppel, M.									Agronomy Research		2006		4	Sp. Iss. SI	341-344	341	344	English						Metalaxyl containing fungicides are commonly used by Estonian potato growers because of their efficiency in control of potato late blight. Metalaxyl-resistant isolates have become an important part of the Estonian population of Phytophtora infestans. The aim of the current study was to measure the frequency of metalaxyl resistance among the Estonian population of Phytophtora infestans and to test the efficacy of metalaxyl-based fungicides in controlling potato late blight. 138 isolates of Phytophtora infestans were collected from conventional, experimental and small scale growers' fields in different parts of Estonia in 20032005 and were assessed for resistance to metalaxyl. Metalaxyl-resistant, intermediate and sensitive isolates were recorded at frequencies of 37.1, 45.4 and 15.1%, respectively. There were differences in frequency of metalaxyl resistance between different locations, years and different types of potato cultivations. Metalaxyl-resistant isolates were predominant (66.7%) on conventional potato fields in 2004 and 2005. Metalaxyl-resistant strains were not detected among isolates collected from the field where fungicide containing metalaxyl was not used. The increased frequency of metalaxyl-resistant isolates was detected in 2003-2005. Trials of late blight control with fungicides containing metalaxyl were performed in the same period. Metalaxyl showed lowered efficacy only in conditions of extreme late blight pressure in 2004. Therefore metalaxyl could be effectively used for control of potato late blight a maximum of two times during the growing period.

Journal of Veterinary Medicine Series B		2003	May 2003	50	4	172-177	172	177	English	print					During epidemic outbreaks in two goatherds clinical symptoms and deaths occurred in five (14%) of the 3-week-old goat kids in farm A, and in six (33%) of those in farm B. In the latter farm, three female goats aborted before the clinical symptoms in the kids emerged. Mycoplasma could be isolated from both healthy and sick goat kids and from female goats, which had diseased kids or had aborted. Three goat kids (one from herd A and two from herd B) were sent for post-mortem examination. In all these cases septicaemia caused by Mycoplasma was diagnosed. Based on the bacteriological examination the Mycoplasma strains proved to be Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri (Mmc). This was confirmed by the PCR examination. Mmc was isolated from several locations includingfrom the rectum of one healthy female goat, and from two diseased kids. In addition, bacteria were detected in the small intestine in two of the necropsied kids by bacteriological and/or immunohistochemical methods. The finding suggests that Mmc may be transmitted via faeces in goatherds, kept under conventional conditions.

Waste Management		2005	05	25	4	417-425	417	425	English						Anaerobic digestion is the principal method of stabilising biosolids from urban wastewater treatment in the UK, and it also has application for the treatment of other types of biowaste. Increasing awareness of the potential risks to human and animal health from environmental sources of pathogens has focused attention on the efficacy of waste treatment processes at destroying pathogenic microorganisms in biowastes recycled to agricultural land. The degree of disinfection achieved by a particular anaerobic digester is influenced by a variety of interacting operational variables and conditions, which can often deviate from the ideal. Experimental investigations demonstrate that Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. are not damaged by mesophilic temperatures, whereas rapid inactivation occurs by thermophilic digestion. A hydraulic, biokinetic and thermodynamic model of pathogen inactivation during anaerobic digestion showed that a 2 log(10) reduction in E. coli (the minimum removal required for agricultural use of conventionally treated biosolids) is likely to challenge most conventional mesophilic digesters, unless strict maintenance and management practices are adopted to minimise dead zones and by-pass flow. Efficient mixing and organic matter stabilisation are the main factors controlling the rate of inactivation under mesophilic conditions and not a direct effect of temperature per se on pathogenic organisms.

Biological assays demonstrated its capacity to be aphid- and graft-transmitted to various Prunus spp. hosts. A study was carried out to determine the further presence of PPV recombinants in two epidemiologically distinct areas - Slovakia and France. Tools based on PPV-M and D subgroup typing, targeting P3-6K1, CI and CP regions of the PPV genome were used for recombinant identification. Closely related recombinant variants were detected in different Prunus spp. during a survey conducted in Slovakia in 2001, but not within a set of selected PPV isolates from France collected between 1985 and 2001. Sequence analysis of the (Cter)NIb-(Nter)CP region of 10 recombinant isolates from Slovakia showed their high homology, reaching more than 98%. All the recombinant isolates shared the same recombination breakpoint situated in the C terminus of the NIb gene. Our study demonstrates that the PPV recombinants are viable and competitive with conventional PPV-M and D isolates. The present work indicates that the occurrence of recombinants within PPV isolates might be more common than previously assumed.

J		Article		Microbial respiratory quotient during basal metabolism and after glucose amendment in soils and litter		Dilly, O.									Soil Biology and Biochemistry		2001	January, 2001	33	1	117-127	117	127	English	print					The microbial respiratory quotient (RQ), defined as the ratio of mol CO2 evolution per mol O2 uptake, was estimated in soils in northern and southern Germany under different land use with and without glucose addition in order to: (i) test the degree of corresponding data of the two procedures, and (ii) evaluate discrepancies with reference to the current eco-physiology of the soil microbiota. The RQ was frequently <1 during basal metabolism when no substrate was added. This indicates relatively high O2 consumption during the current microbial mineralisation of available substrates. Throughout the first 4 h after glucose addition, the RQ values were regularly approximately 1 showing corresponding activity values based on the two procedures. Between 4 and 24 h after glucose addition when microbial growth occurred, the soil RQ was approximately 1.3 or greater but varied significantly depending on land use, soil horizon and soil pre-conditioning. Under such conditions, the RQ value was greater in soils under conventional farming than those under organic farming systems and additionally increased from the L, Of to the Ah horizon in a beech forest. RQ values >1 during the initial period of microbial growth could not be attributed to abiotic soil properties. Thus, the soil microbiota apparently adapt to the degree of complete oxidation and the incorporation of the available substrates. Corresponding measurements of basal and substrate-induced respiration measurements with some litter types also showed RQ values different from 1.

J	9650267	Article		The efficiency of different phenol-degrading bacteria and activated sludges in detoxification of phenolic leachates		Kahru, Anne; Reiman, Rain; Ratsep, Annely									Chemosphere		1998	July, 1998	37	2	301-318	301	318	English	print					Phenolic composition, toxicity and biodegradability of three different phenolic leachates/samples was studied. Samples A and C were the leachates from the oil-shale industry spent shale dumps at Kohtla-Jarve, Estonia. Sample B was a laboratory-prepared synthetic mixture of 7 phenolic compounds mimicking the phenolic composition of the leachate A. Toxicity of these 3 samples was analyzed using two photobacterial test (BioTox and Microtox), Daphnia test (DAPHTOXKIT F pulex) and rotifiers' test (ROTOXKIT F). All the LC50 values were in the range of 1-10%, leachate A being the most toxic. The growth and detoxifying potential (toxicity of the growth medium was measured using photobacterial tests) of 3 different phenol-utilizing bacteria and acclimated activated sludges was studied in shake-flask cultures. 30% leachate A (altogether 0.6 mM total phenolic compounds) was too toxic to rhodococci and they did not grow. Cell number of Kurthia sp. and Pseudomonas sp. in 30% leachate A increased by 2 orders of magnitude but despite of the growth of bacteria the toxicity of the leachate did not decrease even by 7 weeks of cultivation. However, if the activated sludge was used instead of pure bacterial cultures the toxicity of the 30% leachate A was eliminated already after 3 days of incubation. 30% samples B and C were detoxified by activated sludge even more rapidly, within 2 days. As the biodegradable part of samples A and B should be identical, the detoxification of leachate A compared to that of sample B was most probably inhibited by inorganic (e.g., sulphuric) compounds present in the leachate A. Also, the presence of toxic recalcitrant organic compounds in the leachate A (missed by chemical analysis) that were not readily biodegradable even by activated sludge consortium should not be excluded.

J		Article		Survival of bacterial DNA and culturable bacteria in archived soils from the Rothamsted Broadbalk experiment		Clark, Ian M. (ian.clark@bbsrc.ac.uk) ; Hirsch, Penny R.									Soil Biology & Biochemistry		2008	MAY 2008	40	5	1090-1102	1090	1102	English						Dried soil samples from many sources have been stored in archives world-wide over the years, but there has been little research on their value for studying microbial populations. Samples collected since 1843 from the Broadbalk field experiment on crop nutrition at Rothamsted have been used to document changes in the structure and composition of soils as agricultural practices evolve, also offering an invaluable record of environmental changes from the pre- to post-industrial era in the UK. To date, the microbial communities of these soils have not been studied, in part due to the well-documented drop in bacterial culturability in dried soils. However, modern molecular methods based on PCR amplification of DNA extracted directly from soil do not require bacterial cells to be viable or intact and may allow investigations into the legacy of bacteria that were present at the time of sample collection.In a preliminary study, to establish if dried soils can provide a historical record of bacterial communities, samples from the Broadbalk soil archive dating back to 1868 were investigated and plots treated with either farmyard manure (FYM) or inorganic fertilizer (NPK) were compared. As anticipated, the processes of air-drying and milling greatly reduced bacterial viability whilst DNA yields declined less and may be preserved by desiccation. A higher proportion of culturable bacteria survived the archiving process in the FYM soil, possibly protected by the increased soil organic matter. The majority of surviving bacteria were firmicutes, whether collected in 2003 or in 1914, but a wide range of genera was detected in DNA extracted from the samples using PCR and DGGE of 16S rRNA genes. Analysis of DGGE band profiles indicated that the two plots maintained divergent populations. Sequence analysis of bands excised from DGGE gels, from a sample collected in 1914, revealed DNA from alpha- and beta-proteobacteria as well as firmicutes. PCR using Primers specific for ammonia oxidizing bacteria showed similar band profiles across the two treatments in recently collected samples, however older samples from the NPK plot showed greater divergence. Primers specific for the genus Pseudomonas were designed and used in real-time quantitative PCR to indicate that archived soil collected in 1868 contained 10-fold less pseudomonad DNA than fresh soil, representing around 10(5) genomes g(-1) soil. Prior to milling, dramatically less pseudomonad DNA was extracted from recently collected air-dried soil from the NPK compared to the FYM plot; otherwise, the two plots followed similar trends. Overall bacterial abundance, diversity and survival during the archiving process differed in the two soils, possibly due to differences in clay and soil organic matter content. Nevertheless, the results demonstrate that air-dried soils can protect microbial DNA for more than 150 years and offer an invaluable resource for future research. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J		Article		Effects of strip intercropping of potatoes with non-hosts on late blight severity and tuber yield in organic production		Bouws, H.; Finckh, M. R. (mfinckh@uni-kassel.de)									Plant Pathology (Oxford)		2008	OCT 2008	57	5	916-927	916	927	English						The effects of strip cropping of potatoes with cereals or a grass-clover mix in and perpendicular to the main wind direction on foliar late blight severity and tuber yield were studied in large-scale field experiments in Germany. Disease progress was assessed in 12-18 sections per plot and yields determined from the same sections. In 2000, plot size was 3 x 10 m and there were no disease reductions apparently due to interplot interference. In 2001 and 2002, with plot sizes of 6 x 18 and 6 x 36 m in strip-cropped potatoes, disease was significantly reduced by 9-20% and 4-12%, respectively, compared to pure stands of potato, with the greatest reductions in plots planted perpendicular to the wind and neighboured by grass-clover. The most important factors contributing to disease reduction were loss of inoculum outside of the plots and barrier effects of neighbouring non-potato hosts. Only 0-20% of the overall yield variation could be explained by the area under the disease progress curve, depending on cultivar and year. In one year disease effects on the yield of a moderately resistant cultivar were higher than on the yield of a susceptible cultivar. This was probably caused by differences in bulking behaviour. Nutrient limitation appeared to be more important than disease in reducing yields. Yields in the edge potato rows directly neighboured by cereals were significantly reduced in all 3 years, but competition by cereals did not change the disease-yield-loss relationship. Strip intercropping might be a useful component in an overall management strategy to reduce incoming late blight inoculum.

J		Article		Drip irrigation emitter clogging in Dutch greenhouses as affected by methane and organic acids.		de Kreij, C. (Cees.dekreij@wur.nl) ; van der Burg, A. M. M.; Runia, W. T.									Agricultural Water Management		2003	23 May, 2003	60	2	73-85	73	85	English	print					It is believed that the serious clogging of drip irrigation emitters in the Dutch greenhouse industry is caused by methane-oxidising bacteria and/or organic acids used as anti-clogging agents. In this study greenhouses with moderate to severe emitter clogging have been examined. High methane concentrations-up to 69 mg/l-were found both in ground water (GW) and in the water from reverse osmosis (RO); however, in the fertiliser-mixing tanks (MTs), methane concentrations were <0.01 to 9 mg/l. In trials, a methane concentration of 0.11 mg/l in the fertiliser-mixing tank (MT), giving 0.08 mg/l at the emitter outlet, caused severe clogging of tube emitters and after prolonged exposure, also of labyrinth emitters. Slime in the emitter with 'methane treatment' contaminated not only higher carbon and adenosine triphosphate, but also higher element concentrations than in the non-methane treatment. Biofouling increased the deposits of salts (scaling). To avoid emitter clogging, growers using ground water should carefully volatise the methane gas if it is present in the fertiliser-mixing tanks at concentrations higher than 0.01 mg/l, i.e. the detection limit. Organic acids, i.e. acetic acid and formic acid, were shown to increase the growth of Trichoderma, a fungus often isolated from emitter slime. Commercial anti-clogging agents containing organic acids were not effective in killing Trichoderma. It is likely that the carbon of the acids serve as a substrate for the micro-organisms. The use of anti-clogging agents without organic acids is advisable.	de Kreij, C.; Division of Glasshouse Horticulture, Applied Plant Research, 2670 AA, P.O.

Journal of Veterinary Medicine Series B		1994		41	5	320-327	320	327	English						In 1984-1991, the incidence of salmonellas was studied in wild birds from various sites in the Czech Republic. On an agricultural farm with salmonellosis in calves, salmonellae were isolated from eight birds (seven Passer domesticus, one Serinus serinus) of 31 birds examined. On various agricultural farms with no salmonellosis in farm animals, salmonellae were found in two birds (Columba livia f. domestica) of 2186 birds examined. Of 35 birds caught at a municipal waste-dump site, salmonellae were isolated from one specimen (Larus canus). No salmonellae were found in birds living in reed growths and in various military training areas (557 ind 116 birds examined, respectively). In black-headed gulls (Larus ridibundus) from various areas with bodies of water, salmonellae were found in 4.2% of 189 adults and 19.2% of 740 non-flying young examined. S. typhimurium was the most common serotype isolated from gulls. Phage type 101 represented 32% of 48 phage-typed strains. This study shows a relationship between the contamination of the environment with salmonellae and their incidence in wild birds.	Cizek, A.; Smola, J.; Dep. Microbiol. Immunol., Univ.

J		Article		Competitiveness of transgenic sugar beet resistant to beet necrotic yellow vein virus and potential impact on wild beet populations		Bartsch, D.; Schmidt, M.; Pohl-Orf, M.; Haag, C.; Schuphan, I.									Molecular Ecology		1996		5	2	199-205	199	205	English						Beets are a crop of particular concern regarding invasiveness questions because they commonly become feral due to unintentional hybridization with annual forms of wild beets. In this study the performance of transgenic beets resistant to Beet Necrotic Yellow Vein Virus (BNYVV) was compared to the performance of unmodified material from the same breeding line. Both transgenic and control genotypes were also compared to a conventionally bred variety carrying a similar phenotypic trait. Field tests were developed in a step by step fashion in order to study seed emergence and competitiveness in early life stages. The tests quantified the potential ecological advantage of virus resistance under virus and non-virus infestation conditions. In experimental field releases in 1993 and 1994 in Germany, a small but increasingly clear 'additive' ecological advantage of the genetically engineered trait was detected. In both years and all competition treatments, the conventional tolerant variety performed best. An impact of naturalization on natural, nonagricultural habitats may appear in wild beet populations in Italian seed beet production areas. However, a survey of coastal areas of North-Eastern Italy found no virus infestation in 1994, suggesting that an increase in wild beet fitness is unlikely to occur.	Bartsch, D.; Dep. Biol. V, Tech.

J		Article		Scrapie in sheep in Norway, history and epidemiology		Hopp, Petter; Bratberg, Bjorn; Ulvund, Martha J.									Norsk Veterinaertidsskrift		2000		112	5	368-375	368	375	Norwegian	print					Scrapie was for the first time detected in Norway in 1958, in two suffolk rams imported from England. In 1981, scrapie was detected in indigenous Norwegian sheep. Historical records from the first half of the 20th century nevertheless give clinical descriptions of ovine diseases which might have been scrapie. Scrapie has been detected in 58 flocks in six of Norway's 19 counties. In 1995 and 1996, an epidemic of scrapie occurred in the counties Rogaland and Hordaland, involving up to 32 flocks. It has not been possible to connect most of the remaining flocks to other scrapie flocks through contacts during the previous ten years. We anticipate the prevalence of scrapie in Norway to be very low, but under certain circumstances with sheep of susceptible genotypes, active trade and increased infection pressure through clinical cases, Norway may experience small epidemics. It is impossible to ascertain when scrapie was first established in Norway, but the disease may have been introduced into the country with sheep imported from Great Britain around the turn of the 19th century.

The classification and nomenclature follow Schnack (ed.): Ent. Meddr. 52: 1-163. Three species are new to the Danish fauna: 1) Tinea sieueri G. Petersen, 1966 (Tineidae). Bred from an owls nest from a farm in southern Jutland. 2) Phyllonorycier medicaginella (Gerasimov, 1930) (Gracillariidae). Numerous mines found along a highway on Falster and Faro. The foodplants were various Melilotus species and Medicago sativa. The species is currently spreading from the South East towards North West of Europe. 3) Eccopisa effractella Zeller, 1848 (Pyralidae) was found in a single specimen in the island of Falster. It is probably a migrant from central or eastern Europe. Among other species of special interest the following should be mentioned: Euzophera bigella (Zeller, 1848) (Pyralidae). A single specimen from a light trap on Falster. Like the first Danish specimen it was taken in a period when other migrating species were recorded. Denisia augusiella (Hubner, 1796) (Oecophoridae) was found in a single specimen in a garden in the central part of Zealand. The species was believed to be extinct from Denmark. The male genitalia of augustella can be separated from those of albimaculea by the shape of the anellus, which in augustella forms an acute angle, whereas it in albimaculea are right-angled. Phyllonorycter saliciella (Zeller, 1846) (Gracillariidae) was breed from Myrica gale. Cydia tenebrosana (Duponchel, 1843) (Tortficidae) was bred from fruits of Sorbus aucuparia in the same locality where Cydia andabatana (Wolff, 1957) occurs. Syncopacma larseniella (Gozmany, 1957) and Syncopacma taeniolella (Zeller, 1839) (Gelechiidae) both occur in unicolorous forms, but these forms are very rarely seen. Pammene ignorata Kuznetsov, 1968 and Pammene suspectana (Lienig Zeller, 1846) (Tortricidae) were found in numbers in pheromone traps. These species were formerly only found singly in scattered localities in the southeastern part of Denmark.	Zool.

It is managed by nematicides and crop rotation. The tolerance level for most hosts is less than one egg/g soil, but is higher for vetch (2 eggs/g soil). Conventional economic thresholds varied with crop value and nematicide cost. For DD [dichloropropane/dichloropropane] nematicide at current prices, threshold levels were 8 and 2.5 eggs/g soil for peas grown by family farms and commercial farms, respectively. The optimal application rate of DD nematicide increased with initial population level; it was greater at any population level for commercial farms than for family farms. Optimal crop rotation strategies varied with crop value and initial nematode population level. Generally, a host crop can be profitably grown one year in three; at low initial population levels, two host crops can be grown in three years.

J		Article		THE CRAYFISH FISHERY IN FINLAND ITS PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE		WESTMAN K									Finnish Fisheries Research		1991		12		187-216	187	216	English						At present there are three freshwater crayfish species in Finland. Two are natives; the noble crayfish (Astacus astacus) and the narrow-clawed crayfish (A. leptodactylus) and one introduced, the signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus). The natural northern distribution of A. astacus in Finland reaches to about 62.degree. N. Due to stockings the continuous area for distribution of the species extends to present to around 65.degree. N in eastern and to around 67.degree. N in western Finland. A. leptodactylus is encountered only sporadically in a few southeastern border waters. P. leniusculus has since 1967 been stocked in some 100 water bodies. The commerical fishery expanded and exports increased at the end of the 1800s. Exportation was at a peak in 1900, with a total of approx. 15.5 million crayfish exported, making Finland Europe's leading exporter of the commodity. About half of the exportation went to Russia, 33% of Sweden, 14% to Germany and 3% to Denmark. Just a few years later the exportation declined sharply due to the cryfish plague (Aphanomyces astaci). Since the 1920s Sweden has been practically the only country importing. Finnish crayfish. Importation of crayfish in Finland commenced in 1967 and during recent years had exceeded exportation. At its peak, the Finnish crayfish catch ammounted to approx. 20 million specimens. In recent years the catch has been about 3.5 million per year, i.e. around 110 tons. The total economic value of the crayfish catch in 1990 was about FIM 40-45 million. Finland seems to be Europes largest producer of the noble crayfish. Crayfish fishing had considerable economic significance in Finland in the early part of this century, especially as a means to increasing the income of the expanding part of the population owning no land. The crayfish plague spread into Finland from Russia in 1983. The disease spread, through the crayfish fisheries and trade, to most of our crayfish waters devastating their stocks. During the past few decades waterway engineering operations have also caused a lot of damage, particularly in the rivers flowing into the Gulf of Bothnia which are famous for their crayfish production. Other crayfish diseases found in Finland are the burn spot disease (Ramularia astaci), the white tail disease (Thelohania contejeani) and Psorospermium haeckeli. No crayfish mass deaths caused by these diseases have been observed. Without the crayfish plaque, Finland would be particularly well suited by nature for large-scale crayfish production. Effective means of combatting the disease are not known. For the purpose of reviving crayfish production and fishing in plague-waters, stockings of the plague resistant signal crayfish are increasing. Due to a faster growth rate and greater capacity for reproduction, the productivity of the signal crayfish is markedly higher when compared to the noble crayfish in the same lakes. The signal crayfish also seem to tolerate fishing pressure very well. To reduce the risks of spreading crayfish plague it has been proposed that only plague-free signal crayfish should be stocked. These can be reared even if the parents are carrying the plague fungus by using egg stripping and incubation techniques. Noble and signal crayfish cultivation has increased since the late 1970s and at present there are some 40 crayfish farms producing mainly one-summer-old juveniles for stocking. The total production in 1990 was about 155 000 specimens.

Examples are the adoption of 6-m conservation headlands to allow the use of selective herbicides for the control of problem weeds, whilst leaving non-competitive species as a habitat and food source for diverse fauna; a computerised warning system for the control of Phytophthora infestans in the Netherlands, enabling fewer fungicide applications; a computer model (Colibri) which allows French farmers and advisers to forecast development of Sitobion avenae populations in order to predict optimal dates for treatment and recommendations for achieving control of Myzus persicae in peaches grown in Italy which results in least harm to beneficial insects. Lower inputs have often resulted in more cost-effective programmes accompanied by less environmental impact, while support for farmers and growers by well-trained staff has proved to be an important factor contributing to successful outcome of the various projects.

J		Article		Forecasting of Fusarium head blight and deoxynivalenol content in winter wheat with FusaProg		Musa, T. (tomke.musa@art.admin.ch) ; Hecker, A.; Vogelgsang, S.; Forrer, H. R. (hans-rudolf.forrer@art.admin.ch)									Bulletin OEPP		2007	AUG 2007	37	2	283-289	283	289	English						Fusarium head blight is one of the most serious cereal diseases of the world. Epidemics of Fusarium head blight can lead to a decline in grain quality and yield. In addition, grains often become contaminated with mycotoxins, which are harmful to humans and animals. In a field survey of winter wheat in Switzerland, Fusarium graminearum proved to be the most prevalent species responsible for head blight and deoxynivalenol the most common mycotoxin. To elucidate and quantify single or combined effects of cropping factors on F. graminearum infestation and to reduce the risk of mycotoxin contamination of wheat under conservation tillage, we developed the decision support system FusaProg. Our model takes into account the effects of cropping factors, previous crops, soil and straw management, as well as the E graminearum susceptibility of the planted variety. These factors are used as driving variables and are combined with the prevailing weather conditions and growth stage in order to predict the deoxynivalenol content of a specific wheat plot before harvest. To use FusaProg as a threshold-based tool to control F. graminearum with optimized timing of fungicide applications, forecasts of deoxynivalenol contents are conducted during the flowering period. FusaProg is an Internet-based decision support system which not only provides information about the local and regional F. graminearum infection risks; it also forecasts plot-specific deoxynivalenol contamination of winter wheat. In 2006, the system was evaluated by Swiss cantonal plant protection officers, and in 2007, the system will be made available to Swiss wheat producers.

J		Article		Effect of salmon cage aquaculture on the pelagic environment of temperate coastal waters: seasonal changes in nutrients and microbial community		Navarro, Nuria (nuria.navarro@urjc.es) ; Leakey, Raymond J. G.; Black, Kenneth D.									Marine Ecology Progress Series		2008		361		47-58	47	58	English						The effects of salmon farm inputs on pelagic nutrient concentrations and planktonic microbial abundance and biomass were investigated in Loch Fyne, a temperate fjordic environment off the west coast of Scotland. The concentration of photosynthetic pigments and inorganic and organic nutrients, and the abundance and biomass of the autotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms, were determined over a complete annual cycle from 3 depths (5, 15 and 25-30 m) at 4 stations located at differing proximities to the fish farm. Ammonium and dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations and heterotrophic microbial abundance and biomass were significantly higher at the stations nearest to the fish farm, suggesting that these and other nutrients derived from the fish farm may be directly or indirectly enhancing heterotrophic microbial activity. This in turn suggests that the heterotrophic microbial food web was responsible, at least in part, for processing matter and energy released into the pelagic environment from the salmon farm. By contrast, pigment concentrations, including chlorophyll a, tended to be similar at all stations, supporting the conclusions of previous studies that failed to establish a clear relationship between fish farm inputs and phytoplankton biomass. As such, the response of the heterotrophic microbial community is probably a more appro-priate indicator than chlorophyll concentration of local ecological effects of fish farms in temperate coastal waters.

Scandinavian Journal of Infectious Diseases		2002		34	9	683-684	683	684	English	print					Streptococcus suis is a zoonotic agent that can be spread to humans, e.g. butchers, abattoir workers and farmers, by contact with pigs. Human infection is most frequently manifested as purulent meningitis, in combination with deafness and ataxia, but there have been rare reports of septic shock leading to multiorgan failure and death. We report 2 patients with S. suis type 1 infection. One patient suffered an abrupt and severe illness, with septic shock leading to multiorgan failure and death, whereas the other presented with purulent meningitis and deafness. Both patients were immunocompromised. They were most likely infected as a result of handling pork at home. In both cases, the infection was due to S. suis type 1, in contrast to previous reports indicating an association between human infection and S. suis type 2. Epidemiologic surveys of human infection may be of interest, especially among individuals exposed to pigs and pork.

J		Article		Additional experiences to elucidate the microbial component of soil suppressiveness towards strawberry black root rot complex		Manici, L. M. (l.manici@isci.it) ; Caputo, F.; Baruzzi, G.									Annals of Applied Biology		2005		146	4	421-431	421	431	English						Several studies were carried out to investigate the soil microbial components involved in suppressing strawberry black rot root which occurs throughout the Italian strawberry growing region. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of fungi involved in black root rot were combined with several soil microbial parameters involved in soil suppressiveness towards black root rot agents. The first survey, carried out in an intensively cultivated area of northern Italy, identified Rhizoctonia spp. as the main root pathogen together with several typical weak pathogens belonging to the well-known black rot root complex of strawberry crop: Cylindrocarpon destructans, Fusarium oxysporum, F solani, Pestalotia longiseta and others. The root colonisation frequency of strawberry plants increased strongly from autumn to spring at harvesting stage. Rhizoctonia spp. were the only pathogens which followed the rising trend of root colonisation with relative frequency; all the weak pathogens of strawberry black root rot complex did not vary their frequency. Only non-pathogenic fungi decreased from autumn to spring when at least 60% of colonising fungi were represented by Rhizoctonia. These data suggested that the late vegetative stage was the best time to record the soil inoculum of root rot agents in strawberry using root infection frequency as a parameter of soil health. A further study was performed in two fields, chosen for their common soil texture and pH, but with significant differences in previous soil management: one (ALSIA) had been subjected to strawberry monoculture without organic input for several years; the other (CIF) has been managed according to a 4-year crop rotation and high organic input. In this study Pythium artificially inoculated was adopted as an indicator for the behaviour of saprophytically living pathogens in bulk soil. Pythium showed a sharp, different response after inoculation in bulk soil from the two soil systems evaluated. Pythium was suppressed only in the CIF field where the highest levels of total fungi and fluorescent bacteria and highest variability were observed. The suppressiveness conditions towards Pythium, observed in the CIF and absent in the ALSIA field, corresponded with the root infection frequency recorded at the late vegetative stage on strawberry plants grown in the two fields: strawberry plants from the CIF field showed lower root colonisation frequency and higher variability than that recorded on those coming from the ALSIA field.

However, problems with disease control have increased in recent years, which plant pathologists have explained by its ability of forming oospores in potato leaves. Consequently, the P. infestans population over the world has become more aggressive and virulent and late blight on potato stems is common. Oospores could be found in field conditions in potato leaflets with two or more separate spots. In Latvia the P. infestans mating type A2 was found in the 1980s. A laboratory experiment on the formation of oospores in Latvia was started in 2002. The total number of collected samples was 215. The samples were collected from potato trial fields, conventional fields and from private gardens in different regions of Latvia. Many potato leaflets with two spots were observed at the end of the growing season when the disease severity exceeded 50%. The results showed that the formation of oospores on potato leaflets in the field took place in the P. infestans population in Latvia. Oospores were found in 80-94% of the investigated cases.

P. (vincent.bouchet@ifremer.fr) ; Debenay, Jean-Pierre; Sauriau, Pierre-Guy; Radford-Knoery, Joeel; Soletchnik, Patrick									Marine Environmental Research		2007	SEP 2007	64	3	358-383	358	383	English						Sediment cores were collected from April to August 2004 on tidal mudflats of the macrotidal Marennes-Oleron Bay (SW France), famous for the cultivation of Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas). The response of living (stained) benthic foraminifera to short-term biogeochemical disturbances in the sediment and overlying water, which may be involved in oyster summer mortality, was monitored. Short-term hypoxia occurred in early June, in conjunction with a sudden rise in temperature. In mid-June, the ammonia content of sediment porewater increased, leading to potentially maximal flux towards overlying waters. Foraminiferal assemblages, particularly in the topmost layer, were altered. Ammonia tepida was the most tolerant to temperature increase and hypoxic conditions whereas Brizalina variabilis and Haynesina germanica were sensitive to organic degradation and hypoxia. Cribroelphidium gunteri was the most opportunistic during recolonisation. Benthic foraminifera showed that short-term biochemical changes in the sediment are toxic and may be involved in the summer mortality of Pacific oysters. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	9501370	Article		European perspectives on the public health risks posed by farmed game mammals		Fletcher, T. J.									Revue Scientifique et Technique Office International des Epizooties		1997	Aug., 1997	16	2	571-578	571	578	English	print					As consumers have become aware of the health risks associated with the high levels of saturated fats present in conventional red meats, an interest in new domesticants has developed. Meat from these species represents the only sector of the European red meat industry which is currently experiencing growth. The production of meat from grazing animals other than cattle and sheep is not subsidised within the European Union (EU), so that despite the fact that game farming for meat exists in all the Member States, much of the farmed game meat consumed within Europe is imported from the rapidly developing deer farming industry in New Zealand. Less severely regulated industries world-wide also export a great variety of wild game into Europe, but health controls and labelling do not permit the consumer to discriminate between wild and farmed produce, or even between species or countries of origin. This paper describes the scale of game farming within Europe, and the quantities of game imported. The author reviews the diverse production systems in different regions of Europe and the various harvesting systems, including the present measures enforced for veterinary public health reasons, and considers the threats posed by the zoonoses known to affect game mammals and the public health risks posed by contamination. An explanation is given of the differences between the production and processing of farmed and wild game.	Fletcher, T.

J		Article		Effect of natural and agricultural factors on long-term soil organic matter dynamics in arable soddy-podzolic soils: Modeling and observation.		Shevtsova, Lyudmila (viua@online.ru) ; Romanenkov, Vladimir; Sirotenko, Oleg; Smith, Pete; Smith, Jo U.; Leech, Penny; Kanzyvaa, Svetlana; Rodionova, Viktoria									Geoderma		2003	September 2003	116	1-2	165-189	165	189	English	print					Changes in topsoil C content were measured in 60 experiments on soddy-podzolic soils in the Russian Federation, Belarus, Ukraine, Lithuania and Latvia with different management characteristics. The data were compiled with a range of actual climatic parameters for the years of the experiments. The combined impact of different management practices (inorganic fertilizers, organic manure and different rotations), climate gradients and soil properties (initial soil C, clay content) was analysed using a static model. The importance of initial C level interactions with the soil and climatic variables are demonstrated as one of the major factors of soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics. The effect of different treatments for seven long-term experiments at the same site (Barybino, the Moscow Region) was explored using both static and dynamic modeling approaches. The SUNDIAL dynamic model was used to estimate the dynamics of different C pools for the whole 35-year experimentation period. Some adjustments to parameters were necessary to obtain satisfactory results. The management practices tested lead to changes not only in total SOM but also in SOM quality parameters. This was established using a complex of chemical and biological methods. For cropping systems with 50% of row crops manure application increased steady state C values by about 0.2%. High inorganic N fertilization decreased the steady state C values. The negative effect of high inorganic N fertilization was seen to be more pronounced on soil with a higher C content. This influence might be a result of increased organic C mineralization after autumn application of mineral N where there may be no crop present to utilize the fertilizer, resulting in adverse changes in SOM quality. The mineral fertilization contributes significantly to the formation of labile humic substances at the expense of Ca-forms of SOM which are more resistant to microbial decomposition and act as the binding agents of aggregate stability.

SW Germany, we found crayfish specimens with a fungus-like Aufwuchs which after DNA-isolation and sequencing was identified as consisting of a set of previously undescribed Saprolegnia species. This finding may have implications for the farming and conservation of native crayfish as well as for the lake's ecosystem. We propose that spiny-cheek crayfish might function as a disease vector for these potential pathogens.

J	13129612	Article		Determination of epidemiological relationships of Streptococcus agalactiae isolated from bovine mastitis.		Merl, Kristin; Abdulmawjood, Amir; Laemmler, Christoph (christoph.laemmler@vetmed.uni-giessen.de) ; Zschoeck, Michael									FEMS Microbiology Letters		2003	12 September, 2003	226	1	87-92	87	92	English	print					In the present study 79 streptococcal cultures isolated from subclinical mastitis of 54 cows from seven dairy farms (A-G) in Hesse, Germany, were comparatively investigated using conventional and molecular methods. The isolates could be identified as Streptococcus agalactiae, belonging to Lancefield's serological group B by determination of cultural, biochemical and serological properties and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-mediated amplification of species-specific parts of the 16S ribosomal DNA, the 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region and the CAMP factor gene cfb. The investigated group B streptococci were further characterized serologically for specific polysaccharide and protein antigens. Serotyping the isolates revealed a predominance of surface protein antigen X, either alone or in combination with polysaccharide antigen Ia. This could be observed for 39 isolates of farms A, B and C. Six group B streptococci from farm E displayed the serotype pattern III/Rib, two isolates from farm G showed the serotype pattern Ib/calpha. The remaining cultures from farms D and F (n = 32) were non-typable. The occurrence of protein Rib could be confirmed by PCR amplification of the gene rib. The two isolates with serotype pattern Ib/calpha also reacted positively for the cbeta-encoding gene bag. Additional properties which allowed a phenotypic characterization of the S. agalactiae were the degree of pigmentation, growth properties in fluid media and soft agar, the surface hydrophobicity, the ability to hemagglutinate rabbit erythrocytes and their resistance reactions to tetracycline and minocycline. The isolates of the seven farms showed identical or almost identical characteristics. The 79 group B streptococci were additionally investigated by macrorestriction analysis of their chromosomal DNA using the restriction endonucleases SmaI, ApaI and SalI. The restriction patterns obtained by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis displayed identical or closely related patterns for the cultures of the various farms. The pheno- and genotypic characteristics of the 79 group B streptococci of the present study revealed that a single S. agalactiae strain or at least closely related subtypes of this strain were responsible for the mastitis situation of the seven farms.

J	12902272	Article		Detection and quantification of Plectosphaerella cucumerina, a potential biological control agent of potato cyst nematodes, by using conventional PCR, real-time PCR, selective media, and baiting.		Atkins, S. D. (simon.atkins@bbsrc.ac.uk) ; Clark, I. M.; Sosnowska, D.; Hirsch, P. R.; Kerry, B. R.									Applied and Environmental Microbiology		2003	August 2003	69	8	4788-4793	4788	4793	English	print					Potato cyst nematodes (PCN) are serious pests in commercial potato production, causing yield losses valued at approximately dollar sign300 million in the European Community. The nematophagous fungus Plectosphaerella cucumerina has demonstrated its potential as a biological control agent against PCN populations by reducing field populations by up to 60% in trials. The use of biological control agents in the field requires the development of specific techniques to monitor the release, population size, spread or decline, and pathogenicity against its host. A range of methods have therefore been developed to monitor P. cucumerina. A species-specific PCR primer set (PcCF1-PcCR1) was designed that was able to detect the presence of P. cucumerina in soil, root, and nematode samples. PCR was combined with a bait method to identify P. cucumerina from infected nematode eggs, confirming the parasitic ability of the fungus. A selective medium was adapted to isolate the fungus from root and soil samples and was used to quantify the fungus from field sites. A second P. cucumerina-specific primer set (PcRTF1-PcRTR1) and a Taqman probe (PcRTP1) were designed for real-time PCR quantification of the fungus and provided a very sensitive means of detecting the fungus from soil. PCR, bait, and culture methods were combined to investigate the presence and abundance of P. cucumerina from two field sites in the United Kingdom where PCN populations were naturally declining. All methods enabled differences in the activity of P. cucumerina to be detected, and the results demonstrated the importance of using a combination of methods to investigate population size and activity of fungi.

In glasshouse vegetables, biocontrol is the dominant method to control pests while it is much less used in glasshouse ornamentals. On outdoor crops, the use of biocontrol is negligible. The main factors determining future prospects include: research, political initiatives, the scale of organic farming, the interest of companies marketing and advising on biocontrol, and public opinion. Good communication between scientists, advisers, growers, government authorities and the public has occurred for many years in Denmark, and has been essential for the successful implementation of biocontrol in glasshouses. Future development of microbial control (to which some organic growers and some members of the public show concerns) will require both research and a debate among the partners, particularly about environmental safety.

At the bud-break phenological stage, the mean numbers of nonviable and viable conidia on 1 cm pieces of shoots ranged from 1 to about 90 and from 6 to more than 1000 in the integrated and the organic orchards, respectively, for both years. However, viable conidia on shoots were found only in 2 integrated and 6 organic orchards out of the 18 and the viability of conidia was below 2%. The mean numbers of viable and nonviable conidia per 100 buds ranged from 24 to more than 1000 and from 230 to almost 5000 in the integrated and the organic orchards, respectively, for both years. In both years, some 60-85% of the conidia was found on the outer bud scales. The percentage viability associated with the outer bud tissues was below 2% for all the orchards. However, the percentage of viable conidia within the inner bud tissues ranged from 0% to 6% in the integrated and from 2% to 11% in the organic orchards for both years. Differences between the organic and the integrated orchards were clearly demonstrated for overwintered conidia associated with both shoot and bud samples. The relationship between autumn scab incidence and numbers of overwintered conidia associated with shoots or buds was exponential. If the autumn scab incidence was above 40%, then the number of overwintered conidia markedly increased. We conclude that specific treatments for overwintering conidia of Venturia inaequalis may not be necessary in integrated orchards with a low scab incidence in the previous autumn. However, the risk of early scab epidemics initiated by overwintered conidia potentially is high in organic orchards. Preventative measures in early spring and also in the previous year must be established in these orchards.

J	22444742	Article		Effect of starch level and straw intake on animal performance, rumen wall characteristics and liver abscesses in intensively fed Friesian bulls		Jorgensen, K. F. (kirstine.jorgensen@agrsci.dk) ; Sehested, J.; Vestergaard, M.									Animal		2007	JUL 2007	1	6	797-803	797	803	English						The objective was to reduce the incidence of liver abscesses (LAs) in young bulls by reducing the starch content of the concentrate and increasing the straw intake by adding molasses without reducing performance. Eighty-five Danish Friesian bulls (146 +/- 2.6 kg live weight (LW)) were allocated to four treatment groups in a 2 X 2 factorial design and were ad libitum fed either a high (H) (43%) or a low (L) (25%) starch concentrate, and either chopped barley straw (S) or a mixture (Sm) of chopped barley straw and sugar-beet molasses (75:25). The bulls were slaughtered at 440 (+/- 4.2) kg LW (11.3 months of age) on average. The concentrate dry-matter intake (DMI) Was 7.5% higher (P < 0.001), the roughage DMI was 12% higher (P < 0.01), whereas the total net energy intake was 7% lower (P < 0.001) for the L compared with the H concentrate. By adding molasses to the straw, roughage DMI increased from 0.50 to 0.96kg/day (P < 0.001). Average daily gain (ADG) was not affected by treatment. Feed conversion efficiency (FCE) for dry matter (FCEDM) was decreased (P < 0.001), whereas FCE for net energy (FCENE) was increased with the L concentrate (P < 0.01), suggesting a lower utilisation of the cell wall fraction with the H starch concentrate. There were no major effects of treatment on carcass characteristics. The higher roughage intake with Sm prevented rumen wall damage, but did not reduce the number of animals with LAs. The L concentrate did not affect the rumen wall but reduced the level of LA (2 v. 9 animals, P < 0.02). There was a higher level of respiratory diseases in animals fed the H concentrate (P < 0.05). The experiment showed that it was possible to maintain performance and reduce LA by using a lower starch content of the concentrate.	Jorgensen, K.

Different measures in the catchment area, where co-operation with farmers was most important, are combined with the operation of a phophorus elimination plant, in which the main tributary is treated, and with aeration and biomanipulation in the reservoir. All measures together have led to the present oligotrophic state and the excellent hygienic condition of the reservoir.

J		Article		[Phytoplasma and phytoplasma diseases: Vectors, control, and research topics.]	Phytoplasmes et phytoplasmoses: Vecteurs, methodes de lutte et themes de recherche	Cousin, Marie-Therese; Boudon-Padieu, Elisabeth									Cahiers Agricultures		2002	Mars-Avril, 2002	11	2	115-126	115	126	French	print					Phytoplasma vector species belong to hemipters (Figure 1) that are phloem-feeding insects. Three families (Jassidae (Figure 2), Cixiidae and Psyllidae) contain the known vector species. However, information is still lacking on vectors of numerous phytoplasma diseases. A high specificity between vector and disease is frequently observed. It has been shown that phytoplasma circulate, multiply and persist in the body of leafhopper vectors. Though detection of phytoplasma in eggs, nymphs, and adults of Scaphoideus titanus specimen reared on healthy plants has been reported, it is considered as a rule that phytoplasma are not transmitted vertically to the progeny of infected specimen. Among planthoppers, species in the cixiid family are known to transmit phytoplasma belonging to the "stolbur" group and to a closely related group. Among psyllids, several species have been shown to transmit diseases of fruit trees, which are all associated with phytoplasma in the same group. The transmission cycle of phytoplasma depends on the life cycle and ethology of their vectors. Scaphoideus titanus, the vector species of "flavescence doree", is a monovoltine species restricted to Vitis sp., thus conferring to this grapevine yellows the very particular traits of an epidemic disease. In the case of Euscelis plebejus, a vector of "clover phyllody" (Figure 3a), the number of cycles per year and hibernation sites differ with climate, hibernation as larvae occurring in oceanic areas and hibernation as eggs in continental areas. In the case of Hyalesthes obsoletus (Figure 3b) and Pentastiridius beieri, most of the life cycle is carried out underground where eggs and larvae can be found on the plant roots. The aerial stage is limited to winged adults that migrate for about six weeks in summer. These cixiid vectors of "stolbur" phytoplasma are polyphagous species, that ensure to "stobur" phytoplasma complex transmission cycles, with various hosts and a few preferential host plants that can act as phytoplasma reservoirs threatening susceptible crops. The circulation of phytoplasma between insects and plants (Figure 4) and the mechanism of phytoplasma transmission (Figure 5) are described. Phytoplasma are always "intracellular", located inside the cell walls of their hosts, either as "extra-cytoplasmic" in mature sieve tubes of plants, in haemolymph, gut lumen and saliva of insects or as "intra-cytoplasmic" in young sieve tubes of plants and in insect cells. It has been shown that circulation and multiplication of "flavescence doree" phytoplasma in the body of an experimental leafhopper vector (Figure 6) meet with two important specific events, i.e. trespassing of the gut membrane after ingestion and penetration of specific secretor cells of salivary glands. Molecular factors for the specific transmission of phytoplasma by insects are not known. Transportation of phytoplasma-infected plants is dangerous or forbidden (quarantine diseases) even if the specific vector species is absent in the importation area, since potential alternative vector species may be present. Similarly, introduction of an exotic insect species in a new area is dangerous and should be avoided by all means. Scaphoideus titanus was introduced from North America to Europe as eggs inserted in the bark of vine planting material. Quarantine of "stolbur" phytoplasma transmitted by cixiids, should be recommended between Europe, Australia and the Near East where related phytoplasma isolates have been detected. Conventional control methods include sanitary selection, in some cases pruning of branches of woody plants with localized symptoms, destruction of phytoplasma reservoir plants, monitoring of vector species, thermotherapy, cross protection and genetic selection for tolerant or resistant varieties. Phytoplasma are not transmitted through seeds but through vegetative parts. Sanitary selection should include scion and rootstock material. Mother-plants should be carefully screened because of latency of infection or tolerance which may result in healthy-looking, nevertheless infected branches that greatly contribute to propagation and long-distance diffusion of diseases. Pruning of symptom-showing parts of woody plants may be efficient to limit the economical effects of the disease, for instance in the case of "bois noir" or "vergilbungskrankheit" where vine stock is a "dead-end host" for the associated "stolbur" phytoplasma transmitted by the occasional vine-feeder Hyalesthes obsoletus. Similar pruning would be dangerous in the case of "flavescence doree", unless Scaphoideus titanus has been completely eliminated by insecticide treatments. If this is not so, pruning could mask the disease but it would not prevent diffusion of phytoplasma by the vector. In the case of the "witches'broom of Populus nigra cv Italica", pruning of lower branches reduces the movement of vector larvae towards the upper parts of poplar. Destruction of reservoirs is recommended. In the case of "flavescence doree", a quarantine disease, it includes uprooting of diseased vine stocks and of abandoned vine plots which are also a shelter to vector leafhoppers. Direct vector control is available if the vector is restricted to the crop and if the number of generations per year is limited. Compulsory insecticide application programs against Scaphoideus titanus have been developed according to the life cycle of the species and to the transmission cycle of the phytoplasma. Search for natural enemies to be used in biological control is currently being developed. Control schemes are more difficult to set up in the cases of vectors with several generations per year, such as Euscelis plebejus, vector of "clover phyllody" or with numerous host plants including weeds such as Hyalesthes obsoletus, vector of "bois noir", "vergilbungskrankheit" and "decline of Lavandula sp.". The weeds should be eliminated by cultivation practice. Curing of dormant plant material by soaking into hot water (50degree C, 45 min) is efficient on grapevine, use of aerated steam therapy (52degree C, 1 hr) on sugar cane. Cross protection has been reported in the case of fruit trees. More should be known on the mechanism to avoid latently diseased plants. Natural resistance and tolerance are being investigated, as well as possible cultivar feeding preferences of vector species. True resistance to phytoplasma disease is rare but it has been reported in the case of "coconut lethal yellowing". Tolerance has been used to control diseases of fruit trees (Prunus, Malus), forest trees (Fraxinus), ornamental (Prunus virginiana), and aromatic (Lavandula) plants. Feeding preference is suspected in the case of Hyalesthes obsoletus on Chardonnay, a grapevine cultivar which is very susceptible to "bois noir". Monoculture and cultivation of clonal material on large areas may have favoured the development of epidemic diseases or increased the incidence of occasional diseases. Thus, controlling of phytoplasma diseases requires a diversification of the genetic material and an integrated approach of biological, ecological, climatic factors and cultivation practice. Research should aim at a better knowledge of resistance, tolerance and recovery of cultivars. Molecular technology approaches include the study of phytoplasma genes involved in pathogenicity and transmissibility, of the role of major membrane proteins in recognition mechanisms with insect organs and the comprehensive study of the phytoplasma genome. Prospective research might deal with breeding of plants modified by genetic engineering and screened for resistance either to phytoplasma or to vector-insect.

Comparison with culture results showed that 88.5% of 26 culture-positive animals were ELISA positive, as were 55% of 60 animals from 2 culture-positive pig herds. Of 90 animals from 2 high health farms with no clinical symptoms of salmonellosis, 98.9% tested negative. The interlaboratory comparison study found a kappa value of 0.9 between our laboratory (using an automated system) and the manufacturer laboratory (using the manual method). Comparison of ELISA results from all 5 participating laboratories showed very good to excellent agreement, between 85% and 97.5%. We found this assay to be useful for the screening of antibodies against Salmonella present in swine serum. It agrees well with bacterial cultures, is reproducible, sensitive, specific, repeatable, and suitable for automation.	Chow, Eva Y.

L.									Epidemiology and Infection		2006	FEB 2006	134	1	49-56	49	56	English						Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (Map), the cause of ruminant paratuberculosis, has been proposed as the causative agent of Crohn's disease. The objective of this study was to determine whether exposure to clinical cases of bovine paratuberculosis was a risk factor for Crohn's disease. A questionnaire was sent to dairy farmers living on premises where the occurrence or absence of clinical cases of bovine paratuberculosis had previously been determined. The prevalence of Crohn's disease was found to be similar to that reported in other studies in the United Kingdom and showed no association with bovine paratuberculosis. There was, however, a univariate association with geographical region. Ulcerative colitis showed univariate associations with age, frequency of contact with cattle and with smoking. The results do not support the hypothesis that Map plays a causative role in the aetiology of Crohn's disease.	Jones, P.

J		Article		Keeping pristine lakes clean: Loughs Conn and Mask, western Ireland		McGarrigle, M. L.; Champ, W. S. T.									Hydrobiologia		1999	Feb., 1999	395-396	0	455-469	455	469	English	print					The large western Irish lakes are natural salmonid lakes and a unique ecological resource. Lough Mask (82 km2) and Lough Conn (50 km2), Co. Mayo, are among the finest, natural, wild brown trout fisheries in Europe. Recently, however, threats have arisen to water quality in Lough Conn as a result of agricultural intensification. A doubling of phosphorus (P) inputs to Lough Conn for the period 1980 to 1990 caused a number of ecological changes such as an apparent increase in littoral algal production; while arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus L.) have also disappeared from the lake over the same period of time. The changes in Lough Conn appear to represent an early phase in the eutrophication process. The western Irish lakes represent a super-sensitive ecological category requiring particularly strict catchment controls in order to protect the diversity of native flora and fauna including unusual glacial relict species and the unique genetic strains of fish which are present. Catchmentmanagement committees were established in order to study and reverse the perceived early-stage eutrophication problem in Lough Conn and in order to prevent the occurrence of similar problems in the case of Lough Mask. These committees have a sectoral basis covering: agriculture, local authority functions (sewage, rural septic tanks, planning and environmental control), forestry, peat harvesting and drainage works, as well as having representation from the fisheries boards and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Management of these relatively pristine lakes is perhaps a more difficult problem than that of cleaning up an obviously degraded resource. This is especially so since they are located in regions which are economically underdeveloped and where a real need exists to improve economic returns from farming, tourism and industry in the catchments. The importance of developing a sustainable, ecologically-based management strategy which will maintain existing high quality lakes into the next century with their irreplaceable genetic and ecological resources intact cannot be over-emphasised. The challenge is to devise refined management strategies which will eliminate nutrient wastage to waters and yet allow an appropriate level of sustainable development in the area.

J		Article		First report of fish pasteurellosis from malta		Bakopoulos, Vassilis; Peric, Zarco; Rodger, Hamish; Adams, Alexandra; Richards, Randolph									Journal of Aquatic Animal Health		1997		9	1	26-33	26	33	English						The first documented outbreak of fish pasteurellosis in an offshore cage farm for gilthead seabream Sparus auratus in Malta is described. The pathogen entered the farm with juvenile fish and the disease occurred within 2 months of their arrival. Losses first affected small fish (10 g) and then affected larger fish (280 and 325 g). Mortalities were low (1.5% in small fish and 0.2% in the larger fish) and the disease was treated successfully with flumequine. The pathogen isolated from the outbreak was cultured and appeared to be biochemically and phenotypically similar to other strains of Pasteurella piscicida (now known as Photobacterium damsela subsp. piscicida, Ph.d.p.). Western blot analysis of this isolate and other Ph.d.p. isolates with anti-Ph.d.p. rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal antibodies revealed similar reaction patterns and, therefore, antigenicity. The pathological and immunohistochemical appearance of the disease was typical of fish pasteurellosis.	Inst. Aquac., Univ.

The routes of transmission and its zoonotic potential are not fully understood. Pigs have been frequently reported to have E. bieneusi; therefore, we surveyed farm-raised pigs in the Czech Republic to determine its presence and genetic diversity. Spores were detected by microscopy in the faeces of 65 out of 79 examined animals (82%). A species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identified E. bieneusi in 94% of samples. Genotyping based on the ITS regions of the SSU rRNA gene identified that most pigs were infected with the species-specific genotype F, while two animals had the zoonotic genotype D and two had genotype Peru 9. This is the first report of E. bieneusi in swine in the Czech Republic, and demonstrated that most infections were with pig-specific genotypes. Nonetheless, swine may still play a role in the transmission of E. bieneusi to humans. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Finnish Fisheries Research		1992	1992 (1993)	14	0	23-32	23	32	English						Over the last 15 years the status of crayfish populations in Britain has changed dramatically. Many populations of the single indigenous species, Austropotamobius pallipes (white-clawed crayfish), have been eliminated by crayfish plague although many still remain healthy. There are an increasing number of rapidly-expanding, Pacifastacus leniusculus (signal crayfish) and Astacus leptodactylus (narrow-clawed) populations in the wild, particularly in southern England. Procambarus clarkii (red swamp crayfish) also appears able to breed in the wild in London at least. Signal crayfish are being ranched /farmed in many areas of England and Wales although the annual yield is still less than 10 tonnes per year. As of March, 1992 narrow-clawed, noble and signal crayfish may not, by law, be released or allowed to escape into the wild, however, there are still no import restrictions relating to crayfish in Britain. At the present time there are no conservation or management strategies in operation for indigenous or wild introduced crayfish, although it is illegal to collect or sell the indigenous crayfish at any time of the year in Britain. However, the newly-created Joint Nature Conservancy Committee is developing an outline conservation strategy, mainly in response to the forthcoming European Community Habitats Directive, and the National Rivers Authority is funding a 3-year programme to develop such a strategy, along with a management strategy for introduced crayfish species.

Major findings are virtually unchanged age-adjusted mortality rates in the majority of countries, moderate male predominance over years and over countries, relatively younger deaths in Balkan States and Asian countries than in most European and Oceanian countries, very similar increase gradient of age-specific death rates irrespective of the mortality levels, and almost identical risks for bladder cancer deaths in the birth cohorts born after .apprx. 1900. The countries with high mortality in both sexes are characterized by a more aged population, manufacturing, recently moderate industrialization, high energy consumption and less frequent deaths from infective and parasitic diseases. The countries with low mortality in both sexes are characterized by a less aged population, agriculture, recently remarkable industrialization, low energy consumption and more frequent deaths from infective and parasitic diseases. Possible determinants for the international variation in the mortality and universal male predominance in bladder cancer are discussed. Suggested by the present analysis are the etiological roles of both environmental factors and host predisposition, and the equilibrium of the host-environmental interactions in bladder cancer deaths.

In particular, millions of sheep were killed by the disease and by the 'stamping out' policy chosen for disease control. Loss of genetic resources was not evenly spread throughout the UK nor throughout the many different sheep breeds that are native to the UK and for which the UK has a formal responsibility for protection to the United Nations. In fact, the FMD epidemic demonstrated for the first time that sheep breeds comprising large numbers of individuals which are commercially formed, can nevertheless be at considerable risk of extinction. The breeds most affected were those restricted to geographical regions of the UK into which the FMD spread. These regionally important breeds are adopted to their particular regional environments, represent an important living heritage for the UK and are a key component in sustaining the rural economies of sheep forming communities.The events of 2001 provided clear proof that there are two components of the UK's form animal genetic resources demanding protection. One component is already recognised as a priority and is composed of the numerically rare breeds of A domesticated species: these are already under the protection of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust (RBST). The second component has not previously been recognised as a priority for protection. The FMD crisis proved that sheep breeds could exist as large numbers of individuals, but nevertheless face extinction due to their regional location. Urgent attention must be focussed on our Heritage Breeds of sheep. The UK has one of the greatest number of native sheep breeds of any country in the world. The Heritage Breeds provide potentially valuable genetic resources for environmental, low-input forming systems.Heritage GeneBonk was founded during the FMD epidemic specifically to protect sheep breeds at threat of extinction from the disease. A group of academic research scientists established a genetic salvage programme: collecting semen and embryos for protection in a gene bank. Germplasm from seven breeds is in long-term storage. Following the crisis, the scientists involved in the gene bank made a commitment to continue their conservation work in recognition that the Heritage Breeds of sheep in the UK continue to require protection.This paper describes: (1) the work of Heritage GeneBonk (HGB); (2) the threefold mission of The Sheep Trust, the new national charity that evolved from HGB (www.thesheeptrust.org; and (3) the ongoing urgent need for conservation of the UK's Heritage Breeds of sheep threatened by genetic erosion.

J		Article		The harvest of freshwater crayfish, Astacus leptodactylus (Eschscholtz, 1823) in Turkey		Harlioglu, Muzaffer Mustafa (mharlioglu@firat.edu.tr) ; Harlioglu, Ayse Gul									Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries		2004		14	4	415-419	415	419	English						Astacus leptodactylus is naturally and widely distributed in lakes, ponds and rivers throughout of Turkey. It has also been stocked in many freshwater systems in Turkey to establish new populations and to restore crayfish stocks devastated by the plague (Aphanomyces astaci) and some other reasons (i.e., farming and culinary purposes). Human consumption of A. leptodactylus has always been very low in Turkey; therefore, it was exported mainly to Europe until 1986. A plague was observed in 1985 in Egirdir, Apolyont, Sapanca and Manyas lakes which included the main harvest areas, and the fishery was lost within 2 years. Consequently, crayfish harvest was banned in all populations to control the plague. Because of the plague, over-fishing and pollution, the harvest of A. leptodactylus in Turkey declined from approximately 5000 (1984) to 200 (1991) tons annually. In 2000s, there has been a gradual increase in the rate of harvest of A. leptodactylus in Turkey, reaching approximately 1600-1900 tons annually, but the plague is still observed in this species at certain localities. The present study reveals that A. leptodactylus in Turkey needs professional support for recovery, because the present harvest of A. leptodactylus is still nearly 20% of the crayfish catch in 1980s.

Unemployment and low income have been shown in Latvia to be statistically associated with high-risk behaviour involving harvest of wild foods from tick-infested forests, and also with not being vaccinated against TBE. Archival data for 1970-2005 record major changes in the agricultural and industrial sectors, and consequent changes in the abiotic and biotic environment and socio-economic conditions, which could have increased the abundance of infected ticks and the contact of humans with those ticks. For example, abandoned agricultural fields became suitable for rodent transmission hosts; use of pesticides and emissions of atmospheric industrial pollutants plummeted; wildlife hosts for ticks increased; tick populations appear to have responded; unemployment and inequality increased in all countries. These factors, by acting synergistically but differentially between and within each country, can explain the marked spatio-temporal heterogeneities in TBE epidemiology better than can climate change alone, which is too uniform across wide areas. Different degrees of socio-economic upheaval caused by political transition in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia and the Czech Republic can apparently explain the marked variation in TBE upsurge. Causal linkage between national socio-economic conditions and epidemiology is strongly indicated by striking correlations across eight countries between the degree of upsurge of TBE and both poverty and household expenditure on food (R-2 = 0.533 and 0.716, respectively).

J		Article		A review on the cultivation potential of Solea senegalensis in Spain and in Portugal		Dinis, Maria Teresa; Ribeiro, Laura; Soares, Florbela; Sarasquete, Carmen									Aquaculture		1999	June 1, 1999	176	1-2	27-38	27	38	English	print					The sole, Solea senegalensis, is a common high-value flatfish in Southern Europe, commonly reared in extensive aquacultural production in Portugal and Spain. Research in recent years has focused on the production of larvae and juveniles of good quality. Natural spawning of broodstock in captivity has been accomplished, and is the only way viable eggs have been obtained to date. The broodstock feeding regime is based on squid (Loligo vulgaris), being supplemented with polychaetes (Hediste diversicolor) during final maturation. Temperature plays a very important role in the onset and duration of the spawning period, with egg emission stopping below 16degreeC. Observed duration of the spawning period has ranged from 4 to 6 months. The total daily egg collection during the spawning season ranged from 0 to 180 g for a broodstock of 15 fish. Egg fertilization rates varied between 20% and 100%, and the percentage of viable eggs had a mean of 72.1 +- 26.5%. Variations in egg size between batches were detected, with egg size tending to decline during the spawning season. Larvae hatch with an average size of 2.4 +- 0.1 mm total length, but this varies widely by batch. Larvae accept Artemia nauplii as first prey and reach a size of 8 mm by day 15. Metamorphosis starts on 11 days after hatching (DAH) and is completed by 19 DAH. Survival at 19 DAH range from 29% to 87%. From 19 DAH onwards fish are fed live Artemia metanauplii, and reach 16 +- 0.8 mm on 40 DAH. Ponds stocked with unweaned juveniles produced after one year fish with 16.6 +- 2.1 cm total length and 40.3 +- 2.5 g wet weight, with a survival of 20%. Unweaned juveniles stocked together with Sparus aurata reached a size of 35.3 +- 1.8 cm total length and 456.1 +- 3.6 g wet weight after one year fish, with a survival of 8%. Epizootic mortalities due to pasteurellosis have been observed in juvenile S. senegalensis. As in other flatfish, pigmentation abnormalities as well as some malformations associated with themigration of the eye have also been observed. The optimization of the weaning and growout procedures, including the development of appropriate feeding regimes, and further studies into the causes of pigmentation abnormalities are necessary before this species can be reared intensively on a large scale.

J	9693457	Article	Literature Review	Health effects of airborne pollutants particularly in swine confinement houses: A review focusing on aspects of occupational medicine		Nowak, D.									DTW (Deutsche Tieraerztliche Wochenschrift)		1998	June, 1998	105	6	225-234	225	234	German	print					From the point of view of occupational respiratory medicine, an overview on potential health effects of airborne pollutants particularly in swine confinement houses is presented. Airway diseases are the most frequent occupational disorders among farmers in many countries around the world including Germany. Due to various methodological reasons, epidemiological studies in farming populations are more difficult to perform than among non-farmers. Major constituents of swine confinement dust include bacteria, endotoxin, mites, fungal spores, and animal dander. Gaseous pollutants include ammonia, methane, and hydrogen sulfide. In a variety of cross-sectional studies, high prevalences of respiratory symptoms and of non-obstructive (and obstructive) bronchitis and Organic Dust Toxic Syndrome have been reported in pig farmers. Nasal and bronchial provocation challenges with swine confinement dust induce influx of neutrophils and other inflammatory cells as well as mediators. In cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, endotoxin turns out as the probably most relevant parameter associated with lung function impairment. Further studies are clearly needed focusing on the prognosis of non-obstructive bronchitis in swine farmers and on health effects of reducing airborne contaminants in swine confinement houses.

Medycyna Weterynaryjna		2005	APR 2005	61	4	377-379	377	379	Polish						Bovine herpes virus 1 (BHV1) is responsible for serious economic losses in the cattle industry all over the world. The virus causes infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), miscarriages and reproductive disorders. Eliminating seropositive animals is the only effective method of eradicating BHV1 infections, but this is expensive and may only be used in countries with a low prevalence of BHV1 infections. Vaccines are generally used in countries with a high number of cattle infected with BHV1. The major disadvantage of conventional vaccines is that the vaccinated animals are serologically indistinguishable from those which are naturally infected. Marker vaccines with a companion diagnostic test allow for serological discrimination between infected and vaccinated animals and are the basis for BHV1 eradication programs in the cattle population of Western Europe. The aim of the paper was to present some aspects of marker vaccines as described in the European Commissions report.

Acta Veterinaria Hungarica		2007	MAR 2007	55	1	1-9	1	9	English						During a five-year period (2000 to 2004) 74,342 pigs were tested by the intradermal tuberculin test in Croatia. Of them, 248 (0.33%) pigs were positive and 91 (0.12%) were found to be suspicious in 7 out of the 13 farms included in the study. Gross pathological changes characteristic of tuberculosis were observed in tuberculin-positive and/or suspicious swine. Mycobacterium was isolated from the lymph nodes of 183 out of 234 swine (78.2%). For better epidemiological understanding, isolates were typed by conventional methods, PCR and hybridisation. The results show that most of the isolates belonged to the Mycobacterium avium complex (175 isolates, 95.7%). Other isolates belonged to M. fortuitum (6 isolates, 3.3%), M. chelonae (1 isolate, 0.5%), and M. peregrinum (1 isolate, 0.5%). Isolated strains of the M. avium complex were identified as M. a. avium (37 isolates, 21.1%) and M a. hominissuis (138 isolates, 78.9%).

J		Article		Effects of fish farming oriented towards nature conservation in the nature reserve "Craimoosweiher" - Results of a 10-year study of odonate fauna and submersed vegetation	Auswirkungen einer naturschutzorientierten teichwirtschaft im NSG Craimoosweiher Ergebnisse einer zehnjahrigen Untersuchung auf Libellenfauna und Unterwasservegetation	Romstock-Volkl, Von Maria; Rebhan, Wolfgang Voelkl Herbert (wolfgang.voelkl@t-online.de) ; Franke, Thomas; Krug, Reinhard									Naturschutz und Landschaftsplanung		2006	AUG 2006	38	8	251-258	251	258	German						Between 1995 and 2005 the effects of near-natural fish fanning (main fish species: carp) on odonate fauna and submersed vegetation were studied in the nature reserve "Craimoosweiher" in Northern Bavaria. The natural potential of carp increase has been estimated to approx. 150 kg/ha related to a water area of 14 ha. This potential was reached with a stocking rate of only 1500 - 2000 specimens K2 (= two year old carps) (approx. 600 and 1000 kg input, according to fish size). Increased stocking rate led to reduced carp growth. Further, the biomass reduction could not be raised by a higher stocking rate.A total of 28 odonate species was recorded in the pond, with 15 species occurring in all years of investigation. The average annual species number was relatively constant and varied between 16 and 23 species. However, winter draining in 1996 and 2003 led to a subsequent reduction in the density of all damselfly species. The population density of Erythromma najas was influenced most conspicuously; Erythromnia viridulum and Coenagrion pulchellum completely disappeared after winter drainage.The species-rich submersed vegetation (13 species of Angiospermae, 2 species of Bryophyta-Hepaticae, 3 species of Characeae) was dominated by Ceratophyllum submersum and Nalas minor. Like the odonate fauna, the submersed vegetation was negatively influenced by winter drainage. However, the plant species recovered faster than the odonates. Additionally, high fish density (especially roach) led to a decrease in submerse vegetation density and species number. At the same time this decrease of vegetation had a negative influence on the odonate fauna. A reduction of fish density enhanced both submersed vegetation and odonate fauna.The case study "Craimoosweiher" allows the conclusion that freshwater fishery and nature conservation measures not necessarily contradict each other.

Most of the plant protection treatments are being done without thorough analysis of real threats from pests and diseases. The aim of the research is to develop the optimal program of wheat protection against pests and diseases based on integration of various methods of plant protection. Two programs: conventional and integrated were compared. In integrated program the eventual needs and terms of treatments were estimated on the basis of detailed observations of plant infection, pest appearance, their natural enemies and thorough analysis of weather conditions and forecasts. The role of disease resistant wheat varietes and nitrogen fertilizers was also analysed. The research took into account beneficial entomofauna and its influence on pest numbers as well as influence of chemicals used in agriculture on their species. As the result the selective pesticides, safe to beneficial organisms, were selected. The quantity and quality of winter wheat yield was analysed, including protein and gluten contents. The economic effectiveness of various programs of wheat protection against pests and diseases was assessed. The results of research are important both in practical and scientific sense.

J		Article		Composting organic residues: Trace metals and microbial pathogens		Dumontet, S.; Dinel, H.; Schnitzer, M.; Pare, T.; Scopa, A.									Canadian Journal of Soil Science		2001		81	Special Issue	357-367	357	367	English	print					Industrialized societies are responsible for increasing environmental pollution by trace metals, and pathogenic micro-organisms associated with products and wastes of industrial processes and agricultural production, as well as household activities. The objective of this paper is to discuss the effect of composting on the behavior of trace metals and pathogenic micro-organisms, and to present the latest finding on sanitizing and stabilizing organic fractions and trace metals in composted biosolids. Evidence provided by long-term scientific studies in North America and Europe on toxic effects of trace metals on soil micro-organisms and on pathogenic micro-organisms suggests that revisions of the current guidelines on sludge applications on agricultural soils are needed to protect long-term soil fertility. In addition, the antagonism between harmful characteristics of biosolids and their usefulness for agriculture and land reclaiming purposes could be mitigated by using efficient composting treatments. The production and use of harmless organic wastes should be one of our highest priorities in order to protect our health and environment, and to hand over a sustainable agriculture to future generations.

Iss. SI	121-128	121	128	English						The Botanical Garden - Center for Biological Diversity Conservation in Warsaw has assembled a collection of the genus Malus Mill. Since 1987, about 700 accessions have been collected, including about 550 old cultivars which were cultivated before the Second World War. These old cultivars came from scientific institutions and private orchards from all over Poland and from the neighboring countries as well. Twenty common at present cultivars have been included in an exhibit of fruit trees and shrubs recommended for small gardens. Another part of collection contains 150 wild and ornamental apple genotypes, including 98 seedlings of Malus sieversii (Ledeb.) M. Roem from natural biotopes in the Tian-Shan mountains.Since 1995, the varieties in the collection have been evaluated in terms of their growth, blossoming and fruit bearing seasons. Fruits have been described according to UPOV guidelines. Since 2002, damage due to apple scab and powdery mildew has been recorded. Passport data have been compiled for each accession. So far, 218 old local cultivars and 100 wild and ornamental genotypes have been described. Other cultivars and genotypes still await classification. Ten cultivars and 21 wild species have been identified as being especially tolerant to apple scab and powdery mildew.

J		Article		Green manuring with clover and ryegrass catch crops undersown in spring wheat: Effects on soil structure		Breland, T. A.									Soil Use and Management		1995		11	4	163-167	163	167	English						The objective of the present study was to investigate the potential of undersown catch crops to counteract soil degradation after autumn ploughing. Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) were undersown in spring wheat on a loam soil in southern Norway, allowed to grow as cover crops after grain harvest and ploughed in to 20 cm depth as green manure in late October. Ryegrass prevented a collapse of the ridged plough furrow profile during winter, which occurred on grain monoculture and white-clover plots. Also, it tended to improve the water stability of aggregates, aggregate size distribution, bulk density, and pore volume in soil sampled in May. The preservation of the plough furrow profile was mainly attributed to enmeshment by an extensive system of fine roots and less to rhizosphere and microbial effects on aggregate stability. The results showed that ryegrass catch crops may give rapid structure improvements that are likely to contribute appreciably to easier seedbed preparation and less soil degradation in arable farming systems, even if the soil is ploughed in autumn.

J		Article		Changes in soil organic matter, microbial biomass C and ergosterol under a fairy ring of Marasmius oreades		Djajakirana, Gunawan; Joergensen, Rainer Georg									Pedobiologia		1996		40	6	498-504	498	504	English						Samples were taken from the F/H-, Al-, and A2-horizon in the outer zone, ring zone and inner zone of a fairy ring formed by Marasmius oreades (Bolt.) Fr. on a garden lawn. The mineral component of the soil was mainly derived from loess. The amounts of soil organic C, total N, microbial biomass C, and ergosterol were reduced by 46 to 54% in the ring zone and by 25 to 37% in the inner zone relative to the non-invaded outer zone. The water-to-soil organic C ratio was markedly reduced only in the Al-horizon of the ring zone. Ergosterol and microbial biomass C were very closely correlated (r = 0.97) although some horizon-specific differences occurred from zone to zone. An enhanced ergosterol-to-biomass C ratio in the F/H- and A2-layer of the ring zone clearly reflected the invasive growth of M. oreades.	Joergensen, Rainer Georg; Inst.

Journal of Helminthology		2006	JUN 2006	80	2	207-212	207	212	English						Transmission of the fox tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis, the causative agent of human alveolar echinococcosis, is known to depend on various environmental factors which are subject to human influence. Epidemiological data suggest that in most endemic regions anthropogenic landscape changes (e.g. deforestation and agricultural practices) have led to more favourable conditions for the parasite's animal hosts, especially arvicolid rodents, thereby increasing the risk for parasite transmission and human disease. Examples are the conversion of forests or crop fields into meadows and pastures in Europe, China and North America, and overgrazing of natural grassland in central Asia. Other anthropogenic factors include interference with host population densities by wildlife disease control, changing hunting pressure and provision of new habitats, e.g. in urban areas. Domestic dogs may, under certain conditions, get involved in the otherwise largely wildlife-based transmission, and thereby greatly increase the infection pressure to humans. The introduction of neozootic host species may increase transmission, or even initiate the parasite's life-cycle in previously non-endemic regions. Lastly, the parasite itself may be accidentally introduced into non-endemic areas, if suitable host populations are present (e.g. in northern Japan).

J		Article		Soil microbial properties across an encatchment in the moraine, agricultural landscape of northeast Germany		Wirth, Stephan J.									Geomicrobiology Journal		1999	July-Sept., 1999	16	3	207-219	207	219	English	print					Soil microbial properties were studied across a typical, small encatchment in the moraine, agricultural landscape of northeast Germany (Schorfheide-Chorin, Boelkendorf). An equidistant transect was sampled from the summit of a northern-exposed slope down the footslope, farther across a pothole, and up from the foot to the summit of a southern-exposed slope (total length: 315 m, lag distance: 1.8 m). Maximum soil basal respiration activity was detected for the pothole (1.07 mug CO2-C g-1 h-1), which was 2.3 or 3.3 times higher than the mean values for the northern- or southern-exposed slope, respectively. Correspondingly, extractable soil fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolase activity and soil fungal population density exhibited similar but less clearly structured spatial distribution patterns, although soil microbial biomass was lacking a distinct maximum at the pothole segment. Across the entire encatchment, highly significant correlations between soil variables (organic carbon,total nitrogen, water content, pH) and soil microbial properties were detected for basal respiration and FDA hydrolase activity, whereas correlations for soil microbial biomass and fungal population density were less clear or were not significant. Moreover, basal respiration activity was strongly correlated with FDA hydrolase activity (rs = 0.806), whereas other correlations between soil microbial properties were less clear (rs ltoreq 0.5) or were not significant. At a northern-exposed slope segment, a spatial autocorrelation detected for soil microbial biomass revealed a model range of apprx28 m, which was identical to the ranges for organic carbon and total nitrogen. Soil basal respiration was spatially autocorrelated across a range of 22 m.

J	16307070	Article		Methylated arsenic, antimony and tin species in soils		Duester, Lars (lars.duester@uni-essen.de) ; Diaz-Bone, A.; Koesters, Jan; Hirner, Alfred V.									JEM Journal of Environmental Monitoring		2005		7	12	1186-1193	1186	1193	English						Methylated species of antimony, arsenic and tin were examined in urban soils of the Ruhr basin, near the cities of Duisburg and Essen, Germany. The main aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of mono-, di- and trimethylated species of these elements in urban soils. The influence of historical and present land use upon the species content was examined. The distribution of inorganic As, Sb and Sn and their methylated species along the pro. le depth was investigated. As, Sb and Sn speciation was performed by pH-gradient hydride generation purge and trap gas chromatography, followed by inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( HG-PT-GC/ICP-MS). Species' structures were confirmed by GC-EI/MS-ICP-MS. Monomethylated Sb and As were the dominant species detected: the concentration of these metal(loid) species varied between < 0.07-56 mu g kg(-1) per dry mass. All dimethylated species and monomethyltin concentrations were between < 0.01-7.6 mu g kg(-1) per dry mass, and for the trimethylated species of all examined elements, concentrations between < 0.001-0.63 mu g kg(-1) per dry mass were detected. The highest organometal( loid) concentrations were observed in agricultural soils and garden soils; lower concentrations were found in the soils of abandoned industrial sites ( wasteland, primary forest and grassland) and a flood plain soil of the Rhine. This result can be ascribed to both the cultivation and the increased biological activity of the agricultural soils, and the generally higher contamination, the disturbed structure and the artificial substrates ( deposits from industrial sources) of the abandoned industrial soils. Due to periodical sedimentation, the flood plain pro. le was the only one where no depth dependence of organometal( loid) species concentration was detected. The other soil profiles showed a decrease of species content with increasing depth; this was particularly noticeable in soils with a clear change from a horizon with an organic character towards a mineral horizon, i.e. decreasing vitality from pro. le top to bottom. It is not as yet clear whether the organometal( loid) species are formed in the mineral horizons of the profiles or whether they are displaced from the organic, biologically-active horizons towards the mineral horizons. Field studies revealed that soil parameters like pH, water content or temperature did not correlate significantly with the degree of biomethylation observed. In contrast to the lower in vitro biomethylation efficiency of Sb vs. As in microbial incubations, we consistently detected higher proportions of transformed Sb compounds in situ in soil samples. These data may indicate a need to re-examine the currently accepted model of Sb biogeochemical cycling in the real environment.

J		Article		Field evaluation of treatments for the control of the bacterial apical necrosis of mango (Mangifera indica) caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae		Cazorla, Francisco M. (cazorla@uma.es) ; Arrebola, Eva; Olea, Francisco; Velasco, Luis; Hermoso, Jose M.; Perez-Garcia, Alejandro; Tores, Juan A.; Farre, Jose M.; deVicente, Antonio									European Journal of Plant Pathology		2006	DEC 2006	116	4	279-288	279	288	English						Bacterial apical necrosis is a critical disease in the main production area of mango in Europe. It is caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, and produces necrotic lesions on mango buds and leaves, causing severe yield losses due to a decrease of flowering and fruit set. A field study to evaluate control treatments against bacterial apical necrosis was carried out during three seasons on mango trees cv. Tommy Atkins in Huelva (Spain). Experimental treatments included Bordeaux mixture, fosetyl-Al, acibenzolar-s-methyl, gibberelic acid, silicon gel, a mixture between acibenzolar-S-methyl and Bordeaux mixture, and combined applications of fosetyl-Al with Bordeaux mixture or silicon gel. The treatments which caused a consistent reduction in bacterial apical necrosis symptoms at similar levels to the conventional treatment with Bordeaux mixture, were the plant resistance activator acibenzolar-s-methyl and the phosphonate derivative fosetyl-Al applied singly or in combination with other compounds, which could be alternative treatments. These treatments showed a significant decrease in the necrotic buds and/or leaves numbers; however, minor differences in P. syringae-like population levels were observed. The analysis of the inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of cupric compounds against P. syringae strains isolated from mango tissues suggests that the commercial copper-based treatments with Bordeaux mixture used in the management of mango crops do not work in a bactericidal mode of action.

J		Article		Oceanographic settings explain fluctuations in Dinophysis spp. and concentrations of diarrhetic shellfish toxin in the plankton community within a mussel farm area on the Swedish west coast.		Godhe, Anna (anna.godhe@marbot.gu.se) ; Svensson, Susanne; Rehnstam-Holm, Ann-Sofi									Marine Ecology Progress Series		2002	September 12, 2002	240		71-83	71	83	English	print					The influence of hydrographic, biological and meteorological variables on the abundance of Dinophysis spp. and the concentration of diarrhetic shellfish toxin (DST) in the plankton population were investigated in a mussel (Mytilus edulis) farm area on the Swedish west coast. This location provided an opportunity to simultaneously compare Dinophysis spp. cell numbers, concentration of DST in natural phytoplankton assemblages and toxicity of mussel tissues. Sampling was performed every other day from October 10 to November 5, 2000, and on each occasion, 5 randomly selected sites were sampled. During this period, 3 distinct water masses passed through the vicinity of the mussel farm. The second water mass, characterized by low salinity and nitrogen concentration, was probably advected into the area from surface waters in the nearby Skagerrak. This low salinity water also contained a high abundance of Dinophysis spp., and high concentrations of DST were recorded in the phytoplankton population. Multivariate analysis (projection to latent structures by means of partial least squares, PLS) determined that the principal variables influencing the concentration of DST in the plankton assemblage were the causative species (D. acuminata, D. acuta and D. norvegica) and salinity. The abundance of the 3 Dinophysis spp. was inversely correlated to salinity. A rapid increase in the toxicity of mussels in response to the high levels of DST was observed. The concentration of DST had doubled within 2 d of the appearance of Dinophysis spp. After 8 d, the water mass containing Dinophysis spp. was replaced and cell numbers again returned to low levels. The concentration of DST in the phytoplankton samples remained high for another 2 d after the number of Dinophysis spp. had declined and the toxicity of mussels continued to be high for the remainder of the study.

Mycoses		2004	April 2004	47	3-4	168-173	168	173	English	print					Two cases of cryptococcal meningitis occurring in immunocompetent men are described. The first case involves a farmer in whom cryptococcal meningitis was rapidly diagnosed using direct microscopy, latex antigen tests and culture of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In the second case, initial mycological tests on CSF (direct microscopy and culture) were repetitively negative and latex antigen tests gave unconvincing results. The patient was started on triple antituberculosis therapy, on which he improved immediately; therapy was continued for 1 year with the patient remaining well. However, within 1 week of stopping therapy, he had to be readmitted with neurological signs and symptoms. Culture of CSF this time yielded Cryptococcus neoformans and the antigen test was consistently positive. These are the first reported cases of cryptococcal meningitis in immunocompetent patients in Malta.	Zahra, L.

J		Article		Investigating biogeochemical signatures in the lichen Parmelia sulcata at Burnham Beeches, Buckinghamshire, England		Purvis, O. William; Chimonides, P. James; Jeffries, Teresa E.; Jones, Gary C.; Read, Helen; Spiro, Baruch									Lichenologist (London)		2005		37	Part 4	329-344	329	344	English						Biogeochemical signatures were compared in 'living' and 'dead' Parmelia sulcata samples with their oak bark substratum. Eighteen elements reached maximum concentrations in 'dead' lichens, at lower concentrations than reported from industrial regions. High N concentrations in 'dead' lichens confirm exceedances of critical levels established for deciduous woodlands, supported by alien algae and 'nitrophytic' lichen colonization. Negative delta N-15 values recorded in lichen samples indicate N originated mainly from ammonia. Less negative delta N-15 values in healthy samples near busy roads suggest local NO, accumulation by Parmelia. Higher delta N-15 values in bark may result from different processes. Twenty-eight elements reach higher concentrations in healthy lichens near roads carrying higher traffic volumes. Thirteen elements correlate positively with lichen delta N-15, suggesting that delta N-15 is a powerful indicator of the balance between agricultural and vehicular N influx. Maximum Ca and Sr concentrations recorded in bark and their spatial distribution suggest a local geological origin. High concentrations of Ga, Ba, Pb and Ni bark contents testify to a previous pollution legacy, including that from petrol which carried higher lead concentrations than today. Mn concentrations are higher than reported from other studies and show no clear relationship with local roads. Mn is known to limit lichen diversity and health in coniferous forests in US and Germany, but not yet in deciduous woodlands. Current atmospheric conditions and the former pollution legacy must be understood to conserve epiphytes and for biomonitoring.	Purvis, O.

J		Article		Sulphur cycling in Danish agricultural soils: Turnover in organics fractions		Eriksen, J.									Soil Biology and Biochemistry		1997		29	9-10	1371-1377	1371	1377	English						The turnover of S in the microbial biomass and its incorporation into organic matter with different degrees of physical protection was investigated. In a field study, three soils were mixed with carrier-free 35S and combinations of S and cellulose in PVC cylinders cropped with perennial ryegrass. In the absence of cellulose, the recovery of 35S in soil organic matter was 5-15 and 10-20% for the +S and -S treatments, respectively. The presence of a C source increased the total 35S incorporation considerably, and the recovery in the + S and -S treatments was 20-30 and 40-50%, respectively. Incorporation of 35S into the fraction not.protected by soil structure reached a maximum between 8 and 14 d after amendment and then slowly decreased over the next months. In the fraction physically-protected by soil structure, the incorporation of 35S was slow in the first 2 wk, but then increased until 12-16 wk after the start of the experiment. The results suggest that, initially, 35S Was incorporated into organic matter not protected by soil structure and then gradually redistributed into physically protected organic matter. Organic S was not accumulated in the unprotected fraction, whereas the protected fraction appeared to be a storage for organic S, at least in the short term. The treatments did not significantly affect microbial biomass S, which may be partly due to variations caused by the field conditions employed. In contrast, the incorporation of 35 S into microbial biomass was significantly higher in the C treatments (19% recovery in the -S + C treatment) than without C amendment (4% recovery). The recovery of 35S in the microbial biomass remained relatively constant, although immobilization increased, indicating that 35S immobilized by the microbial biomass was transformed directly into soil organic S.

J	15376208	Article		Atopic and non-atopic asthma in a farming and a general population		Eduard, Wijnand (Wijnand.Eduard@stami.no) ; Omenaas, Ernst; Bakke, Per Sigvald; Douwes, Jeroen; Heederik, Dick									American Journal of Industrial Medicine		2004	October 2004	46	4	396-399	396	399	English	print					Background In a previous study inverse associations between asthma and exposure to fungal spores and endotoxins in atopic farmers and positive associations with the same factors in non-atopic farmers were documented. No external reference population had been included. We, therefore, compared this farming population with the general population from an adjacent region. Methods Random samples of a farming (n = 2,106) and a rural (n = 351) and urban (n = 727) general population were selected. Atopy was assessed by serum IgE and asthma by questionnaires. Results The asthma prevalence was 4.0% among farmers, 5.7% in the rural, and 7.6% in the urban population. Atopy was similar (9-10%). Most asthmatics were not atopic, 67-75%. Farmers had asthma less often than the general population OR 0.52 (95% CI 0.36-0.75); both atopic (OR 0.33 (95% CI 0.15-0.69)) and non-atopic asthma (OR 0.60 (95% CI 0.39-0.93)). Conclusion This may indicate a protective effect of the farm environment on asthma but a healthy worker effect may also play a role. Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

J		Article		TBE vaccination and the Austrian experience.		Kunz, Christian (virologie@univie.ac.at)									Vaccine		2003	1 April, 2003	21	Supplement 1	S1/50-S1/55			English	print					In the pre-vaccination era, Austria had the highest recorded morbidity of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in Europe. The disease accounted for more than 50% of all viral meningoencephalitides in the eastern and southern parts of the country. This prompted us to start a cooperative vaccine development project in 1971 with J. Keppie from the Microbiological Research Establishment, Porton Down, England. After very satisfactory results of field studies, conducted in individuals for whom TBE was classified as occupational disease (forest workers, farmers, etc.), the killed virus vaccine (see chapter by N. Barrett in this issue), was made commercially available by Immuno AG Vienna (now Baxter Health-Care). The vaccine proved to be highly immunogenic and very well tolerated in both adults and children. After completing the series of three vaccinations seroconversion rates of >99% were recorded. In Austria, as in other European countries, TBE is now acquired for the most part during leisure activities. In view of this fact a mass vaccination campaign was initiated in 1981. Subsequently, the vaccination coverage of the Austrian population increased from 6% in 1980 to 86% in 2001, exceeding 90% in some of the high-risk areas. Data annually collected by our surveillance system show that the clinical effectiveness of the vaccine is excellent. Based on the assumption that the whole Austrian population is at risk of infection the calculated rate of protection after three doses of the vaccine is 96-98.7%. Breakthrough disease is rare and affects mainly higher age groups. Since the advent of TBE vaccination only one single case has been observed in the age group up to 20. The increasing vaccination coverage led to a more or less steady decline of TBE, drastically reducing the public health problem that the disease poses in Austria, especially in the provinces, where formerly the highest morbidity rates were observed. For example, in Carinthia, in the years 1973-1982 an average annual incidence of 155 was recorded, compared with only four annual cases in the last 4 years. The Austrian experience shows that containment of a tick-borne viral disease is feasible, provided a well-tolerated and effective vaccine is available that is widely accepted by the general population.

Total bacteria in the effluent were such that they might potentially bring about immediate increase in the bacerioplankton populations of recipient rivers. Directly counted bacteria increased cumulatively through rows of well-stocked fish ponds arranged in series, thus all ponds contributed to the increase in suspended bacteria. In contrast, bacterial numbers varied irregularly through rows of low-density stocked and fallow ponds. The increase in bacteria in well-stocked ponds was greatest shortly after the daily feeding time.	Goulder, R.; Dep.

Ten apricot cultivars of North American origin: 'Stark Early Orange', 'Stella', 'NJA2', 'Sunglo', 'Veecot', 'Harlayne', 'Henderson', 'Goldrich', 'Orangered' and 'Early Blush', selected for their resistance to the highly virulent local strain of Plum pox virus (PPV)-M (Marcus), have been used as parents in crosses with quality cultivars, mainly with the local cv. Bebecou, from 1989 to 2003. Approximately 7000 hybrids have been created. Resistance to PPV was the main criterion of selection. Most hybrids have been subjected to artificial inoculation by PPV-M and examined for symptom expression for more than five years. Indexing to GF-305, as well as laboratory diagnostic tests, have been applied. The genetic analysis showed that: (1) 50% of the hybrids inherited resistance to PPV in the families where cvs. Stark Early Orange, NJA2, Sunglo, Veecot and Harlayne were used as a parent, and (2) 100% of the hybrids inherited resistance to PPV in the families where cv. Stella was one of the parents. Resistance to PPV appears to be under simple genetic control involving one gene locus. Promising apricot selections resistant to PPV-M have been released.

Isolates, identified by conventional and molecular analyses, were represented by both ascomycetous (64%) and basidiomycetous (36%) strains. While Pichia guilliermondii and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa were the most commonly isolated species from the bodies of host insects, several other species were consistently associated with insects. The ecological significance of these findings is discussed.

J		Article		Biotechnology initiative to achieve plant pest and disease resistance		Raman, K. V.; Altman, David W.									Crop Protection		1994		13	8	591-596	591	596	English						Biotechnology applications are primarily proprietary, with apprx 70% of the annual global research expenditures of US11 x 10-9 being in the private sector. The International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications (ISAAA) addresses this challenge by building a new partnership of three donor groups (bilateral/multilateral agencies, private philanthropic foundations, and private companies) to support a not-for-profit institution within existing centres of excellence (Cornell University in North America, John Innes Centre in Europe, Technova in the Asian Pacific Rim, and three additional locations to be established in developing countries). Brokered projects involve only near-term technologies with a high probability of success, using tissue culture/micropropagation, disease diagnostics and transgenic plants. The main targets for transgenic plants are coat protein-mediated protection for non-conventional virus resistance (NCVR) and insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt); both NCVR and Bt can contribute to integrated pest management strategies using reduced inputs for chemical control of insects. Four ISAAA projects demonstrate the potential of NCVR and Bt in developing countries: (1) potato resistant to potato viruses X and Y with Mexico/Monsanto/Rockefeller Foundation, (2) melon resistant to cucumber mosaic virus with Costa Rica/Asgrow Seed/USAID and the ISAAA Fellowship Program, (3) papaya resistant to papaya ringspot virus with Brazil and other countries/Cornell University/Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA), and (4) cotton resistant to Lepidoptera with Brazil/EMBRAPA. Although over 1000 field trials of transgenic plants have taken place worldwide, those experiments have been mostly small scale and do not provide sufficient data to assess either the durability of resistance achieved with genetic engineering or conclusive public acceptance of this technology. However, resistance management modelling is speculative and can not decisively indicate a deployment strategy in the absence of continued monitoring and experimentation. ISAAA's projects should allow opportunities for assessment of resistance management practices for applied plant biotechnology to control agricultural pests under diverse production systems.	Raman, K.

J		Article		Long-term effects of historical heathland farming on soil properties of forest ecosystems		von Oheimb, Goddert (vonoheimb@uni-lueneburg.de) ; Haerdtle, Werner; Naumann, Pascale S.; Westphal, Christina; Assmann, Thorsten; Meyer, Hartmut									Forest Ecology and Management		2008	APR 5 2008	255	5-6	1984-1993	1984	1993	English						Much of Europe's landscape has been converted from agricultural land to forest over the last 150 years. Previous land-use activities may have persistent effects on forest ecosystem properties, yet there is scant information on the long-term recovery of forest soils from agriculture. In this study we examined the effects of historical heathland farming on forest soil properties by comparing (i) ancient oak forests with oak stands afforested more than 115 years ago on (ii) former heaths and (iii) formerly cultivated fields in NW Germany. Our results showed that former fields had significantly lower C, N, and P stores and lower C/N- and C/P-ratios in the organic layer than former heaths and ancient oak forests, but revealed more plant-available P, higher total P contents and low C/P-ratios in the A-horizon. We concluded that higher plant-available P and P stores in the A-horizon reflected well the former manuring of fields, while lower C, N, and P stores in the O-horizon were related to the age of the forest floor. Differences between former heaths and ancient forests were less pronounced and characterized by a low base saturation (BS) and high C/N-ratio in the organic layer of ancient forests, attributable to nutrient sequestration in forest biomass and to changes in microbial communities, respectively. In our study, organic layer and A-horizon served as complementary tracers for land-use legacies, since some of the effects of historical heathland farming were only detectable by means of properties of one of the humus horizons. Our findings demonstrate that heathland farming needs to be considered as a "historical site factor" when analysing forest ecosystem processes, since soil legacies resulting from heathland farming may still impact present-day patterns of biodiversity and tree growth in lowland forest ecosystems.

(konrad.sachse@fli.bund.de)									Zoonoses Public Health		2008	MAY 2008	55	4	184-188	184	188	English						In 2005, an outbreak of severe respiratory disease in a mixed poultry flock that was infected with Chlamydophila (C.) psittaci led to dissemination of the infection to at least 100 small poultry farms in I I districts of Central Germany. At the same time, a total of 24 persons in contact with poultry from one of the flocks reported flu-like symptoms to their physician, thus suggesting zoonotic transmission. Within 3 weeks, seven individuals had to be hospitalized, with three of them requiring intensive care. Analysis of ompA sequences from chlamydial isolates and directly from clinical samples revealed the presence of both genotype A and E/B of C. psittaci at the source of the outbreak and in contact flocks. Genotype A was also detected in the three severely ill patients. The findings of the present study demonstrate the high zoonotic potential of avian chlamydiae. To ensure speedy eradication of psittacosis in poultry flocks and effective treatment of infected humans, fast, sensitive and species-specific detection of the causative agent is essential, as well as close collaboration between regional public health services, attending physicians and the diagnostic laboratories involved.

J	7778506	Article		Epidemiology of cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis in Moravia and Silesia		Kolek, Vitezslav									Acta Universitatis Palackianae Olomucensis Facultatis Medicae		1994		137	0	49-50	49	50	English						Cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis in Moravia and Silesia (4 million inhabitants) was evaluated using standard epidemiological and clinical parameters. During 1981-1990 the incidence of cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis ranged from 0.74 to 1.28/100,000. The trend of incidence was increasing slightly. The prevalence rose from 6.5 to 12.1/100,000. The male/female ratio was 1:1.2; 54% of patients were less than 40 years old. Biopsy (mostly open lung biopsy) supported the diagnosis in 38% of cases. During 1981-1990 years 379 new cases were detected, 488 cases altogether were registered up to 1990. The death rate calculated by incidence and prevalence was 13% and 10% resp. The mean regional incidences varied from 0.34 to 2.69/100,000, regional prevalences varied from 4.1 to 27.6/100,000. No correlation with the regional incidences of sarcoidosis and tuberculosis was found. No significant differences in coal mining areas with a high occurrence of pneumoconiosis or in areas with developed agriculture were detected. Significantly higher values were found in the regions of the four major diagnostic centres: a mean incidence of 1.58/100,000 and a mean prevalence of 20.8/100,000 (p lt 0.05). The results suggest that the level of diagnostic possibilities and efforts dominates over ecological and environmental factors in the detecting of cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis.	Dep.

Twenty-nine sera from 22 individuals were shown to have antibodies specific for E. coli O157 LPS. Some of these lived on livestock farms and had occupational contact with cattle, suggesting that personnel working with farm animals may produce serum antibodies to the O157 LPS antigens. Fifteen people had IgG class antibodies to O157 LPS, suggesting long-term exposure to E. coli O157 and five people had serum antibodies on more than one occasion showing evidence of persistent antibodies to O157 LPS. Thirteen sera from 12 of 22 individuals also contained antibodies to VT1, VT2 or both toxins. Ten sera contained antibodies to VT1 and VT2, three sera contained antibodies to VT2 only.

Journal of Environmental Science and Health Part B Pesticides Food Contaminants and Agricultural Wastes		2002	January, 2002	B37	1	81-91	81	91	English	print					Farm waste stores are widespread in the UK, with many overlying the principal aquifer, the Chalk. The stores pose a threat to groundwater quality through the infiltration of high concentrations of nitrogen species and organic carbon together with pathogenic microbes. Two cored boreholes have been drilled into the unsaturated chalk to depths of 15 and 20 metres, respectively, through a site which has been used to store turkey litter for in excess of 20 years. Porewaters were extracted from the cores and analysed for a range of chemical elements. In addition, chalk core material was also taken for microbial examination. Both boreholes showed very high concentrations of nitrate-N (3000 mg/L), ammonia (5000 mg/L), organic carbon (3000 mg/L), and potassium (10,000 mg/L) in the top 5 metres of the profile. Below this depth concentrations declined dramatically. Highest concentrations were found in the borehole constructed in the middle of the site. The borehole constructed at the edge of the store showed much lower concentrations but did show a peak of nitrate around 10 metres below ground level. The apparent lack of movement beneath the centre of the store suggests the turkey litter is relatively impermeable and most leaching occurs where the covering of litter is thin or when the litter is annually cleared. If the leachate continues to migrate at this apparent rate, it will take more than 100 years to reach the water table.

J	8517656	Article		Environmental pollution and malignant lymphomas: A tentative contribution to geographic pathology		Hatzissabas, Ilias; Krueger, Gerhard R. F.; Rojo Medina, Julieta; Bedoya, Victor A.; Papadakis, Theodora									Anticancer Research		1993		13	2	411-417	411	417	English						The present study reports of the geographic distribution of 2,878 cases of uniformly classified malignant lymphomas and of 2,349 similar cases from the literature. Data on histological entities are compared with the geographic and socio-economic characteristics of the regions where they preferentially occur. The results provide three patterns in lymphoma distribution: small cell lymphocytic lymphomas are frequent among populations of European extraction and in farming rather than industrial regions. Lymphomas derived from cells of the germinal center are seen preferentially in so-called "underdeveloped countries", and large cell (immunoblastic) lymphomas appear rather characteristic of industrial areas. Besides genetic influences (rare chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in Asia as compared to Europe), the results suggest environmental cofactors in the pathogenesis of malignant lymphomas. CLL is more frequent in areas with rather low-dose chronic toxic influences such as from the use of fertilizers and pesticides in farming. Germinal center cell lymphomas tend to occur more frequently in countries with nutritional and hygienic deficiencies with frequent infectious diseases. Large cell high malignancy lymphomas apparently prefer highly industrialized regions with pollution of water supplies by more toxic and immunosuppressive substances.

J	9120075	Article		Patterns of clinical mastitis manifestations in Danish organic dairy herds		Vaarst, Mette; Enevoldsen, Carsten									Journal of Dairy Research		1997		64	1	23-37	23	37	English						Danish organic dairy production is characterized by a low input of antibiotics for udder treatment and a high input of other mastitis control procedures. A study was conducted in 14 organic dairy herds with the objectives of obtaining a comprehensive description of clinical mastitis cases and identifying characteristic patterns in these results. Clinical signs, inflammatory reactions and microbiological identifications were obtained from 367 cases of clinical mastitis occurring over 18 months. Cow characteristics and preincident values such as milk yield and somatic cell count were obtained for each cow. Signs of previous udder inflammation were present in two-thirds of the clinical mastitis cases. Severe local inflammatory reactions were found in 21% of the cases and some indication of generalized signs such as fever and reduced appetite were found in 35% of the cases. Logistic regression analyses were performed based on the results of an initial (exploratory) multiple correspondence analvsis. Coliform mastitis (6% of the cases) was rarely preceded by pathogen isolation or inflammatory reactions in the same quarter. Coliform mastitis cases usually occurred in one quarter only. Escherichia coli infections were typically (truly) acute cases. Bacteriologically negative mastitis (20% of the cases) showed strong similarities with clinical coliform mastitis. Staphylococcus aureus cases (18% of the cases) occurred most frequently in late lactation or around drying-off. Prior isolation of Staph. aureus and slight decreases in milk yield were two factors that interacted but both were strongly and positively related to clinical Staph. aureus. Staph. aureus mastitis typically had a subclinical debut, and increasing degrees and duration of inflammation decreased shedding of this pathogen. Streptococcus dysgalactiae (9% of the cases) mastitis was typically persistent, virulent and manifest in periods of lower cow resistance. More patterns of subclinical and clinical Str. uberis mastitis (23% of the cases) seemed to be present.	Danish Inst.

The survey revealed that viral hepatitides with the parenteral mechanism of the transmission of infective agents were widely spread among the population. In the arctic zone HBsAg was detected in persons aged 20 years and older in 10.8 - 17.1% of cases. On the average, in the arctic zone antibodies to virus DELTA were detected in 2.4% of cases. In different regions of the agricultural zone. the detection rate of HBsAg was also high (10.4 - 23.8 %). In the Namsk and Vilyui regions DELTA infection was registered among adolescents (15 -19 years of age) in 8.7 and 22.4% of cases respectively. In the Mountainous region anti-DELTA antibodies were detected among persons aged 20 years and older in 31 % of cases. The survey showed the presence of considerable differences in the detection rate of the markers of hepatitis B, depending on the ethnic origin of the examined patients. Similar tendencies were found to exist with respect to DELTA infection.	Kuzin, S.

It has been stated that in the edafoclimatic conditions of the Basque Country denitrification losses are more important than those produced by leaching, spring and autumn being the seasons with a greater risk of losses. These losses are great and immediately occurring after mineral fertilization and small but distributed along the time when organic fertilization is applied.	Estavillo, J.

(mette.vaarst@agrsci.dk) ; Bennedsgaard, T. W.; Klaas, I.; Nissen, T. B.; Thamsborg, S. M.; Ostergaard, S.									Journal of Dairy Science		2006	MAY 2006	89	5	1842-1853	1842	1853	English						Promotion of animal health and well-being at the individual animal and herd level is an important goal in organic farming. At the same time, chemical products affecting the natural balance among living organisms are prohibited in all areas of the organic farm. From an animal welfare point of view, however, no animal must suffer. Therefore, veterinary drugs are allowed under the European Union's regulations for organic farming, despite the fact that they are powerful cell toxins affecting both pathogenic and necessary bacteria, and as such in organic terminology, are regarded as "chemical" or "artificial" products. In this article, we present and discuss interviews with 12 Danish organic dairy producers who claim that minimized use or nonuse of antimicrobial drugs is an explicit goal. The dairy producers were at different levels with regard to reduced antimicrobial treatment. An explicit strategy of no antimicrobial treatments is based primarily on a long-term effort to improve herd health, and secondarily, on finding alternative treatments for diseased animals. Improved hygiene, outdoor access, use of nursing cows, and blinding of chronic mastitis quarters were the main techniques in developing a strategy of not using antimicrobial treatments in the herd by dairy producers. Producers' perception of disease changed from something unavoidable to a disturbing break in the daily rhythm that often could have been avoided. Change toward a nonantimicrobial strategy was gradual and stepwise. All dairy producers in this study desired to preserve the possibility of using antimicrobial drugs in emergencies.

In 1986 the bacterium was isolated for the first time from diseased salmonids in Finland. After an initial decrease in the number of isolates of P. anguilliseptica per year, the bacterium was isolated in 1991 from about 12% of the examined fish samples from disease outbreaks in Finnish fish farms in the Baltic Sea. P. anguilliseptica has gradually spread over the whole main fish farming area off the southwest coast of Finland. Recently the bacterium was also isolated from one farm on the ANG land Islands on the southwest coast of Finland. In the present investigation P. anguilliseptica was recovered mainly from diseased farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) but also from farmed salmon (Salmo salar), sea trout (Salmo trutta m. trutta), and whitefish (Coregonus sp.). In several cases P. anguilliseptica was co-isolated with other fish-pathogenic bacteria like Vibrio anguillarum and Aeromonas salmonicida.	Wiklund, Tom; Inst.

Faecal and manure samples were collected and analysed by immunomagnetic separation and culturing. Data were recorded for each herd regarding herd size, age of sampled animals and whether, in addition to cattle, the farm kept other animals. VTEC O157 was isolated from 33 (8-9%) of the 371 investigated herds. The prevalence was higher (23.3 %) in Halland county than in the rest of Sweden (P > 0.01). Halland was also the county in Sweden that during the study period had the highest incidence of human VTEC O157 cases. VTEC O157 was not detected on any farm in northern Sweden. Identified risk factors, in the multivariate analyses, for herds being VTEC O157 positive were herd size, geographical localization, presence of pigs on the farm and median age of sampled animals.

J		Article		Interaction between native and alien species of crayfish in Austria: Case studies.		Pockl, M. (Manfred.Poeckl@noel.gv.at) ; Pekny, R. (Reinhard.Pekny@aon.at)									Bulletin Francais de la Peche et de la Pisciculture		2002	Decembre 2002		367	763-776	763	776	English	print					In Austria, three indigenous crayfish species occur: the noble crayfish (Astacus astacus), the stone crayfish (Austropotamobius torrentium), and the white-clawed crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes). It is not known if Astacus leptodactylus is autochthonous in the very eastern part of Austria, near the border with Hungary and Slovakia. In other parts of Austria the Turkish crayfish has been transplanted into several gravel pits and ponds. Up to now, the red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) is not known to occur in the wild, but can be bought alive in fish markets, restaurants, and the aquarium trade. The Nearctic spiny-cheek crayfish (Orconectes limosus) and the signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) have been introduced since the 1970s by crayfish farmers because these species are resistant to the crayfish plague fungus (Aphanomyces astaci). There are just a few populations of O. limosus, and the species is not spreading actively. However, P. leniusculus is widespread all over Austria, and was illegally introduced from one water body to another. It can be characterized as an aggressive, invasive North American species, spreading actively and acting as a vector of the crayfish plague. Unfortunately the habitat requirements of the native noble crayfish and the alien signal crayfish are nearly the same. Case studies are given in the following chapters: the first group of examples refers to water bodies where the alien signal crayfish is most probably the cause of displacement of the indigenous noble crayfish: 1) Hintersee, 2) Irrsee ("Zeller See"), 3) north-western Lower Austria ("Waldviertel"), 4) Merzenstein (aquacultural enterprise), 5) Neufelder See. The second group of examples refers to water bodies where alien and indigenous species are able to coexist: a) the confluence of the main course of the Danube River, the Olhafen and the Neue Donau in the southeast part of Vienna, b) the Schonauer Wasser, a backwater of the Danube River downstream Vienna, c) backwaters and ox bows of the Morava River. The differences between these two groups are analysed, and it is speculated on possible causes allowing coexistence. Some conclusions are drawn. Important actions related to the protection of native crayfish are briefly discussed.

To prevent and control a national outbreak, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) conducts measures based on the ecology of avian influenza viruses. To prevent an outbreak in the United States, the USDA conducts surveillance of bird populations, restrictions on bird importation, educational outreach, and regulation of agricultural practices, in collaboration with local, state, and federal organizations. To manage an outbreak, the USDA has in place a well-established emergency management system for optimizing efforts. The USDA also collaborates with international organizations for disease prevention and control in other countries.

J		Article		General features of the Estonian flora and vegetation		Paal, Jaanus									Svensk Botanisk Tidskrift		1995		89	2	119-128	119	128	Swedish						Estonia lies on the East European plain. The differences in altitude are rather small, but nevertheless the landscapes have a varied and partly unique character with a multitude of different habitats. The Estonian flora comprises c. 9000 species (2500 algae, 3700 fungi, 750 lichens, 512 bryophytes, 44 pteridophytes, 4 gymnosperms and 1400 native angiosperms). Among the vascular plants mesophytes dominate (55%), followed by hygrophytes (20%) and xerophytes (17%). Species of Rosaceae, Fabaceae, Brassicaceae, Asteraceae, Caryophyllaceae, Poaceae and Cyperaceae make up almost half of the total number of vascular plants species. Nearly 1/4 of the vascular plant species have limits of distribution within the country. Forests make up c. 40% of the territory whereas c. 54% is used for agriculture. In the forests 22 basic forest site types are identified they can be subdivided into at least 70 forest types. Wooded meadows have an extremely high species richness and therefore have a particularly great value for preservation of biodiversity. Of the peatlands 55% are fens, 5% mesotrophic transitional mires and 40% bogs.	Dep. Bot.

(peter-thorne@uiowa.edu)									Environmental Health Perspectives		2007	FEB 2007	115	2	296-297	296	297	English						A scientific conference and workshop was held March 2004 in Iowa City, Iowa, that brought together environmental scientists from North America and Europe to address major environmental health issues associated with concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) in large, industrialized livestock production facilities. After one and a half days of plenary sessions, five expert workgroups convened to consider the most relevant research areas, including respiratory health effects, modeling and monitoring of air toxics, water quality issues, influenza pandemics and antibiotic resistance, and community health and socioeconomic issues. The workgroup reports that follow outline the state of the science and public health concerns relating to livestock production as they apply to each workgroup topic. The reports also identify areas in which further research is needed and suggest opportunities to translate science to policy initiatives that would effect improvements in public and environmental health. Viable solutions to some of the current environmental health problems associated with CAFOs are outlined. In addition, these reports bring to lot several major concerns, including air and water contamination, the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in livestock, and the specter of influenza outbreaks arising from siting industrialized poultry and swine production in proximity to each other and to humans.

J		Article	Literature Review	Unravelling the paradox of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus emergence, using phylogenetic analysis; possible implications for rabbit conservation strategies		Forrester, N. L. (nlf@ceh.ac.uk) ; Trout, R. C.; Turner, S. L.; Kelly, D.; Boag, B.; Moss, S.; Gould, E. A.									Biological Conservation		2006	AUG 2006	131	2	296-306	296	306	English						During the past 50 years two readily distinguishable rabbit-specific diseases caused by Myxoma virus (MYXV) and Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) respectively, have decimated wild rabbit populations worldwide. Combined with the use of these viruses as bio-control agents, the consequences for farming, commercial rabbit breeding and rare habitat conservation dependent on rabbit grazing, have been both positive and negative. Moreover, rare predators that rely on rabbits as a food resource, and even hunters, have suffered the consequences of rabbit populations being affected by one or other of these viruses.Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus was first identified after thousands of domestic rabbits died suddenly in China in 1984. Similar epidemics subsequently occurred in other regions of Asia, the Middle East, Europe and North America, suggesting that the virus had dispersed widely following its emergence in China. However, the discovery that RHDV had circulated apparently harmlessly for many years before the first recognised epidemic in China prompted us to investigate the evolution, emergence and dispersal of this virus in relation to its impact on conservation of wildlife species. Accordingly, we have sequenced new isolates of RHDV and combined these data with a global selection of available RHDV sequences. Using phylogenetic analysis we demonstrate that the Chinese epidemic virus diverged from European viruses that circulated many years prior to 1984. We also demonstrate that the lineages of the pathogenic viruses that emerged in the UK in the early 1990s, are distinct from and pre-date those of the 1984 Chinese virus. In other words, European strains of RHDV emerged from apparently harmless strains to cause epidemic outbreaks, independently of the Chinese 1984 epidemic virus. These studies demonstrate how understanding viral epidemiology can improve the development of strategies to conserve rabbits, rare predator species and the habitat. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

B		Book Chapter Meeting		Conservation of farm animal genetic resources - a UK national view		Mansbridge, R. J.			Simm, G; Villanueva, B; Sinclair, KD; Townsend, S						FARM ANIMALS GENETIC RESOURCES	BSAS Publication	2004		30		37-43	37	43	English		Conference on Farm Animal Genetic Resources	Edinburgh, UK	200211,	British Soc Anim Sci; Dept Environm, Food & Rural Affairs; Rare Breeds Survival Trust; Sheep Trust	In 2003 the Rare Breeds Survival Trust (RBST) celebrated its 30th anniversary and is now widely recognised as the national non-governmental organisation responsible for rare breeds of farm livestock in the UK. No breed of farm animal has been lost since 1973 and there are now 72 breeds which meet the Trust's criteria for recognition as a rare breed. These criteria, which are regularly reviewed, take into consideration how long the breed has existed, the number of adult females and geographic distribution. With one or two notable exceptions, the breeds listed by the Trust have built up numbers and have become well distributed. However, all rare breeds still face an uncertain future but their greatest enemy is no longer immediate extinction but extinction by stealth. The sustained downward pressure on livestock forming in the UK, National and European government legislation, loss of genetic diversity and public indifference make a dangerous combination.So what can an organisation like the RBST do, funded entirely by membership subscriptions, donations and legacies? The answer is a great deal! Firstly, we need to make people care, so that Governments and legislators listen and consider the implications of new (and existing) legislation on rare breeds. There is strong evidence that where people are seen to care, then government does listen to 'umbrella' organisations like the RBST lobbying on behalf of a small and sometimes fragmented sector of the industry. Widespread concern during the early days of the recent Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) epidemic in the UK enabled the Trust to secure unprecedented exemption for rare breeds of sheep and pigs from contiguous culls. However, unlike captive zoo collections or wild populations, the individual cattle, horse/ ponies, pigs, poultry and sheep/goats belong to individual breeders! Without their support, co-operation and participation, progress can be difficult and slow. This national role, to be effective and comprehensive, must be grounded in sound science, reliable technical data and impartial information. The Trust now has the expertise and the tools to quantify the genetic diversity in rare breeds while offering practical solutions to some of the problems facing rare breeds. The RBST is doing a great deal but there is still much to do. The next 30 years promise to be as important in securing the future of the UK's rare breeds of farm livestock as the first 30 years were in rescuing them from extinction.	Mansbridge, R.

In addition, a histopathological study was done of rootstock roots naturally infected by root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.). Nematodes infecting the rootstocks were identified according to conventional procedures, and the Meloidogyne spp. were furthermore identified by sequence characterized amplified region-polymerase chain reaction (SCAR-PCR) and isozyme esterase analyses. The most important plant-parasitic nematodes detected. in Order of decreasing frequency of total soil infestation and root infection (percentage of samples). were Mesocriconema xenoplax (34.4%), Meloidogyne incognita (26.6%), Meloidogyne javanica (14.1%). Xiphinema index (12.5%), Xiphinema italiae (10.9%), Pratylenchus vulnus (6.3%), and Meloidogyne arenaria (1.6%). No disease symptoms were observed on aboveground plant parts of the infected grapevines, except for plants in some fields where soil was infested with the virus-vector nematodes X. index and X. italiae. Those grapevines showed a yellow mosaic pattern in leaves early in the growing season and the internode shortening, characteristic of infections by Grapevine fanleaf virus. Rootstocks infected by root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) showed distorted feeder roots and large- to moderate-sized root galls, present either singly or in clusters. Histopathology of galled roots showed a typical susceptible response to infection by root-knot nematodes: cellular alterations were induced in the cortex. endodermis, pericycle, and vascular system, including giant-cell formation and severe distortion of vascular tissues. Most Meloidogyne egg masses ocurred on the surface of the galled root tissues. a position that could facilitate dispersion of the nematode eggs and juveniles and the occurrence of secondary infections. Some of the grapevine rootstocks surveyed in this study (Paulsen 1103. Richter 110, Rupestris du Lot, and SO4) had previously been reported to be resistant to Meloidogyne spp.; however, the population densities of these nematodes found in soil and roots sampled in the present study, as well as the compatible host-parasite relationship revealed by histopathology. indicate a susceptible response to Meloidogyne spp. from southern Spain.

J		Article		Ratios between estimates of microbial biomass content and microbial activity in soils		Dilly, O.; Munch, J.-C.									Biology and Fertility of Soils		1998	Sept., 1998	27	4	374-379	374	379	English	print					The content levels and activities of the microbiota were estimated in topsoils and in one soil profile at agricultural and forest sites of the Bornhoved Lake district in northern Germany. Discrepancies between data achieved by fumigation-extraction (FE) and substrate-induced respiration (SIR), both used for the quantification of microbial biomass, were attributed to the composition of the microbial populations in the soils. In the topsoils, the active, glucose-responsive (SIR) versus the total, chloroform-sensitive microbial (FE) biomass decreased in the order; field maize monoculture (field-MM)>field crop rotation (field-CR) and dry grassland>beech forest. This ratio decreased within the soil profile of the beech forest from the litter horizon down to the topsoil. Differences between microbial biomass and activities suggested varying biomass-specific transformation intensities in the soils. The metabolic quotient (qCO2), defined as the respiration rate per unit of biomass, indicates the efficiency in acquiring organic C and the intensity of C mineralization, while biomass-specific arginine-ammonification (arginineammonification rate related to microbial biomass content) seems to be dependent on N availability. The qCO2, calculated on the basis of the total microbial biomass, decreased for the topsoils in the same order as did the ratio between the active, glucose-responsive microbial biomass to the total, chloroform-sensitive microbial biomass, in contrast to qCO2 values based on the glucose-responsive microbial biomass, which did not. There was no difference between the levels of biomass-specific arginine-ammonification in topsoils of the fertilized field-CR, fertilized field-MM, fertilized dry grassland and eutric alder forest, but levels were lower in the beech forest, dystric alder forest, and unfertilized wet grassland topsoils. Ratios between values of different microbiological features are suggested to be more useful than microbiological features related to soil weight when evaluating microbial populations and microbially mediated processes in soils.

J	12734623	Article		Determination of zearalenone and ochratoxin A in soil.		Mortensen, Gerda Krog (gerda@rh.dk) ; Strobel, Bjarne W.; Hansen, Hans Christian B.									Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry		2003	May 2003	376	1	98-101	98	101	English	print					Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites, formed by the action of fungi on agricultural crops in the field or during storage. These metabolites are highly toxic to animals and humans and high levels have been measured in agricultural crops. In order to evaluate human risks due to ingestion of mycotoxin-contaminated food different methods have been developed for analysis of mycotoxins in cereals and maize. In this project the focus was on mycotoxins in agricultural soil and the fate of these toxins in the soil-water-plant system. Two different mycotoxins were selected in the study: zearalenone (ZON) produced by species of Fusarium or Aspergillus and ochratoxin A (OTA) produced by species of Penicillium. We developed a method for analysis of these toxins in soil. Soil samples were extracted with methanol-water (9:1) and purified by solid-phase extraction (SPE, C8-columns). The final extract was analysed using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection. A Phenyl Hexyl column was used to separate the toxins. The detection limits obtained were 0.1 and 1.0 mug kg-1 dry weight (dw) for OTA and ZON, respectively. The developed method has been used for analysis of different soils in connection with growth chamber experiments. The soil types used in the growth chamber experiments were a sandy soil, a sandy clay soil, and a soil with high content of organic matter. The recovery was determined as 85.8 and 93.4% and the repeatability to 5.1 and 12.8% for OTA and ZON, respectively. The reproducibility obtained was 8.5 and 15.0% for soil samples, representing concentration levels from 0.2-30 mug kg-1 dw (OTA) and from 1.0-100 mug kg-1 dw (ZON).

J	14723364	Article		Human Leptospirosis in Bulgaria, 1989-2001: Epidemiological, clinical, and serological features.		Christova, Iva (iva_christova@yahoo.com) ; Tasseva, Evgenia; Manev, Hristo									Scandinavian Journal of Infectious Diseases		2003		35	11-12	869-872	869	872	English	print					A total of 455 confirmed and reported to the Bulgarian Ministry of Health leptospirosis cases between 1989 and 2001 were analysed. Overall incidence of the disease was 0.42/100.000 population (range 0.20-0.64/100.000). The overall fatality rate was 6.6%. Infection was acquired through occupational (30.3%), recreational (45.1%), and accidental (4.6%) exposure or was home contracted (5.1%). A tendency towards the main mode of transmission moving from occupational to recreational exposure was noted. Fishing and livestock farming together accounted for more than half of all leptospirosis cases. Leptospirosis was contracted more frequently through indirect contact with animal excreta and less commonly through direct contact with animal urine or tissue. Serovars belonging to 10 different serogroups caused infection during the 13-year study period. Two serogroups, Icterohaemorrhagiae and Pomona, accounted for more than 87% of all leptospirosis cases. The third main cause was serogroup Australis. The significant change in the infecting serovars has to be related to widely performed vaccinations of cattle and pigs but still inefficient measures for rodent control. The most frequently reported symptoms were fever, myalgia, jaundice, and hepatomegaly. Anicteric cases (40.3%) had milder flu-like course. Acute renal failure was reported in 52 (33.8%) of the patients, all of them with icteric leptospirosis. Knowledge of epidemiological, clinical, and serological features of leptospirosis in Bulgaria during the 13-year study period is an appropriate base to outline measures for successful prevention and early diagnosis of the disease.

J		Article		Characterization of Rhizoctonia solani from potato in Great Britain		Woodhall, J. W. (j.woodhall@csl.gov.uk) ; Lees, A. K.; Edwards, S. G.; Jenkinson, P.									Plant Pathology (Oxford)		2007	APR 2007	56	2	286-295	286	295	English						One hundred and thirty five isolates of Rhizoctonia solani were obtained from British potato crops between 2001 and 2003. Isolates were assigned to anastomosis group (AG) using conventional PCR assays for AG2-1 or AG3 or through the observation of hyphal interactions, where appropriate. A previously published primer set was modified in this study to enhance specificity for AG3PT. Most of the isolates (92 center dot 6%) belonged to AG3PT whilst some (6 center dot 7%) belonged to AG2-1. Only one isolate recovered (0 center dot 7%) belonged to AG5. Isolates of AG2-1 were diverse, with variation in both the length of the rDNA intergenic spacer 1 (IGS1) region and the categories of hyphal interaction observed between pairings of AG2-1 isolates. No variation in the length of the rDNA IGS1 region was observed amongst the AG3 isolates collected. Tests carried out on potato stems with a sub-set of the isolates revealed a wide range of aggressiveness amongst AG2-1 isolates. Sequencing of the rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the AG2-1 isolates and construction of a neighbour joining tree with other AG2-1 sequences available indicated that AG2-1 isolates with the short IGS1 region were closely related. This is the first investigation which provides evidence of the relative AG composition of R. solani populations causing disease in potato crops in Great Britain.	Woodhall, J.

New Zealand Journal of Crop and Horticultural Science		2006	JUN 2006	34	2	173-175	173	175	English						Leaf samples were collected from 138 tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) plants showing symptoms of Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) in the north-west Mediterranean region of Turkey. The samples were first tested by double antibody sandwich-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) using CMV specific polyclonal antibody. The DAS-ELISA revealed that 53 of the 138 leaf samples tested were infected with CMV. One of the ELISA-positive CMV isolates was mechanically inoculated into a set of indicator plants by conventional leaf inoculation method for further characterisation. The virus was multiplied and showed systemic symptoms in Nicotiana tabacum `Xanthii', Nicotiana tabacum 'Samsun NN', and Capsicum annuum. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was isolated from uninfected and infected N. tabacum 'Xanthii' and C. annuum plants by CF-11 cellulose chromatography. Agarose gel electrophoresis showed that CMV-specific dsRNA was present in infected N. tabacum 'Xanthii', Nicotiana tabacum 'Samsun NN', and C. annuum plants but not in healthy plant samples. This result agreed with the biological and serological findings and confirmed the presence of CMV on tomato growing in the northwest Mediterranean region of Turkey.

J		Article		Bovine tuberculosis in badger (Meles meles) populations in southwest England: An assessment of past, present and possible future control strategies using simulation modelling		White, Piran C. L.; Harris, Stephen									Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B Biological Sciences		1995		349	1330	415-432	415	432	English						A spatial stochastic simulation model was used to compare the efficacy of different badger control policies and to determine the theoretical requirements for the control of endemic bovine tuberculosis in badger populations in southwest England. Culling-based strategies for controlling endemic disease were compared with strategies employing a yet-to-be-developed oral vaccine which would provide uninfected badgers with immunity to the infection. A comparative assessment was made of the efficacy of previous and proposed culling-based strategies employed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for the control of localized disease, and the potential for an oral vaccine-based strategy for the control of localized disease was examined. For endemic bovine tuberculosis, to achieve a reasonable probability (p gt 0.70) of successful control with a strategy involving a single culling operation, a very high proportion of the badger population ( gt 90%) must be culled. Single vaccination would not be successful in combating endemic disease. However, strategies involving repeated annual vaccination would have a very high probability of eradicating endemic disease, even with a relatively low (40-50%) annual vaccination efficiency. The most successful culling-based strategies for the control of localized disease were the gassing and clean ring strategies. Compared with no control at all, the interim strategy only offered benefits of a lower probability of disease spread and persistence in populations with low disease-free equilibrium group sizes or low initial prevalences of infection. In all other instances the benefits were negligible. The live test strategy will offer an improvement over the interim strategy, but will not be as effective as either the gassing or clean-ring strategies. In addition, it is likely to necessitate the culling of approximately four times as many badgers each year as the interim strategy, and the proportion of those killed that are infected will be approximately half that under the interim strategy. The efficacy of a strategy involving annually repeated oral vaccination of the badgers within a similar area to that covered by the live test depended on the efficiency of vaccination. A vaccination efficiency of 20-60% represented an overall improvement in efficacy over the interim strategy, being equivalent to the live test strategy. However, only vaccination efficiencies of 60-80% or greater achieved similar results to the gassing strategy, and none were so successful as the clean-ring strategy. Recommendations for future management are provided. Reactive strategies based on culling or vaccination will not solve the problem of bovine tuberculosis in badgers. Proactive strategies directed in those areas with a recent history of bovine tuberculosis in badgers should be considered as an alternative short-term control measure. The only strategy likely to eradicate bovine tuberculosis from badger populations in the long term is the use of repeated vaccination in proactive control operations in areas with a history of bovine tuberculosis in the badger population. Analyses should be conducted to evaluate whether the economic benefits of the live-test strategy are likely to outweigh its economic and ecological costs and whether continued research into the development of a vaccine for badgers is likely to offer any significant long-term economic benefits.

J		Article		PCR Identification of Fusarium graminearum Isolated from Wheat Grain		Koncz, Zs; Huszti, K.; Naar, Z.; Kiss, A.; Szecsi, A. (aszecsi@nki.hu)									Cereal Research Communications		2008	DEC 2008	36	4	623-630	623	630	English						Species-specific PCR assay was used for the identification of Hungarian Fusarium graminearum isolates in pure mycelial culture. The Fg16F/Fg16R primer pair of the three known species-specific primers appeared to be the most appropriate one to identify F. graminearum. Two methods were used for comparative determination of the amplicon size of F. graminearum strains: traditional agarose gel electrophoresis, and chip electrophoresis. Our results have shown that the chip electrophoresis is an easy-to-use, time-efficient substitute for conventional agarose gel electrophoresis; moreover it provides a more precise size determination of amplicons. Amplicon size ranging from 415 by to 421 by in tested isolates may be associated with genetic diversity in the Hungarian population of F. graminearum.The PCR assay described in this study can be used for the routine detection and identification of F graminearum without isolation and morphological investigation of this fungus.

J		Article	Literature Review	Water-level management as a tool for the restoration of shallow lakes in the Netherlands.		Coops, Hugo (h.coops@riza.rws.minvenw.nl) ; Hosper, S. Harry (h.hosper@riza.rws.minvenw.nl)									Lake and Reservoir Management		2002	December 2002	18	4	293-298	293	298	English	print					Water-level fluctuations are among the major driving forces for shallow lake ecosystems. In the low-lying parts of the Netherlands, the water-level regime of lakes is strictly regulated. This is needed for reducing risks of flooding and economic purposes, including maximum agricultural benefit. The fixation of water levels has had a severe impact on the functioning of (semi-)aquatic ecosystems. We review the benefits of natural water-level fluctuations, considering the impacts on nutrient inputs, nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton development and turbidity. In particular, the mediating role of submersed and emergent vegetation and filter feeders is addressed. The present government policy, to allow more space for water, presents a major challenge for combining flood prevention measures and ecological restoration. Restoration of natural water-level regimes, which is likely to lead to enhancement of water quality and biodiversity, may occur in two ways: (1) expanding the critical limits between which the water level is allowed to fluctuate annually, and/or (2) incidental recessions of the water level. It is stressed that ecologically-based water-level regimes should be incorporated into the context of multiple use of lakes.	Coops, Hugo; Hosper, S. Harry; RIZA, 8200 AA, P.O.

J		Article		The effect of beta-estradiol and corticosteroids on chlorophylls and carotenoids content in Wolffia arrhiza (L.) Wimm. (Lemnaceae) growing in municipal Bialystok tap water.		Czerpak, R.; Szamrej, I. K.									Polish Journal of Environmental Studies		2003		12	6	677-684	677	684	English	print					It is well known that many steroid compounds, mainly from large stock-raising farms, more frequently end up in rural or communal sewage systems. It is also known that the duckweed family (Lemnaceae), especially Wolffia arrhiza, is more and more commonly used in the biotechnology of purifying the above-mentioned sewage systems due to its heterotrophic and detoxication ability, as well as its ease of adoption to unfavorable environmental conditions. Therefore, our research analyzes the influence of beta-estradiol and chemically and functionally diversified corticosteroids: cortisone, cortisole (glucocorticoids), 11-deoxycorticosterone (mineralocorticoids) and prednisolone (chemical derivative of hydrocortisone) on chlorophylls and carotenoids content in photoautotrophic Wolffia arrhiza (Lemnaceae), growing in municipal Bialystok tap water (rich in minerals but poor in organic components). From the applied steroid hormones in optimal concentration of 10-6M beta-estradiol caused the strongest stimulatory effect on photosynthetic pigments, a little less strong - cortisone, slight stimulative - cortisole, and weak 11-deoxycorticosterone. Prednisolone showed a weak inhibitory influence on all types of chlorophylls and carotenoids in comparison with the control culture without exogenous hormones. Applied steroid hormones had a weak stimulative influence over chlorophylls a and b in Wolffia; the strongest was beta-estradiol between the 5th and the 10th day of cultivation, in the range of 116.5-121.3% in comparison to the control value (100%). The researched steroids had a much stronger influence on carotenoid content, especially beta-carotene, alloxanthin (oxygen - poor xanthophylls) and violaxanthin (oxygen - rich xanthophylls). Under the influence of beta-estradiol the amount of beta-carotene rose by the maximum 160.6%, alloxanthin by 187.9% and violaxanthin by 154.3% in comparison to the control. Our research results demonstrated that beta-estradiol and - from applied corticosteroids - cortisone and hydrocorticosterone, had more stimulatory influence on carotenoid content in Wolffia arrhiza, but less stimulatory effect on unicellular Chlorella vulgaris.

Tissue sections stained with the biotynilated lectin GS-I revealed the presence of this protozoan in only one of the farms. In rainbow trout, the renal prevalence and parasite density peaked in July, but in brown trout the maximum renal prevalence and maximum renal parasite density were reached in May and in July, respectively. In rainbow trout, after the acute phase of the disease, the number of PKX decreases in the kidney but increases in the muscle. In this species of fish, the prevalence and parasite density are much higher in the muscles than in the kidney in October.	Castillo, Juan A.; Dep. Patologia Animal, Fac. Veterinaria, Univ.

Of the 43 recorded PD outbreaks, 57% occurred in the 3 mo period August to October inclusive (17 to 32 wk post-transfer). Analysis of variance of mortality rates during PD outbreaks occurring on 6 marine sites over a 5 yr period showed that mortality rates vary significantly between sites (p < 0.001) but not between years over this time period. The mortality rate during PD outbreaks ranged from 0.1 to 63%. Mortality rates were significantly higher when PD outbreaks occurred earlier in the year (y = -1.28x + 59, SE of b 0.33). The mean length of a PD outbreak was 112 d (SE = 7.7, n = 37). There was no correlation between PD mortality rate and smolt input weight, initial stocking density and transfer mortality.

(i.sauli@gmx.ch) ; Danuser, J.; Geeraerd, A. H.; Van Impe, J. F.; Rufenacht, J.; Bissig-Choisat, B.; Wenk, C.; Stark, K. D. C.									International Journal of Food Microbiology		2005	APR 15 2005	100	1-3	289-310	289	310	English						Contaminated feed is a source of infection with Salmonella for livestock, including pigs. Because pigs rarely show clinical signs of salmonellosis, undetected carriers can enter the food production chain. In a "Farm to Fork" food safety concept, safe feed is the first step for ensuring safe food. Heat treatment or adding organic acids are process steps for reducing or eliminating a contamination with Salmonella. The aims of this study were (I) to estimate the probability and the level of Salmonella contamination in batches of feed for finishing pigs in Swiss mills and (II) to assess the efficacy of specific process steps for reducing the level of contamination with Salmonella. A quantitative release assessment was performed by gathering and combining data on the various parameters having an influence on the final contamination of feed. Fixed values and probability distributions attributed to these parameters were used as input values for a Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation showed that-depending on the production pathway-the probability that a batch of feed for finishing pigs contains Salmonella ranged from 34% (for feed on which no specific decontaminating step was applied) to 0% (for feed in which organic acids were added and a heat treatment was implemented). If contamination occurred, the level of contamination ranged from a few Salmonella kg(-1) feed to a maximum of 8E+04 Salmonella kg(-1) feed. Probability and levels of contamination were highest when no production process able to reduce or eliminate the pathogen was implemented. However, most of the Swiss production was shown to undergo some kind of decontaminating step. A heat treatment, in combination with the use of organic acids, was found as a solution of choice for the control of Salmonella in feed. (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Hence, methane emissions and methanogen populations were examined at sections with different degree of cattle impact in a Farm in South Bohemia, Czech Republic. In spring, methane emission positively corresponded to the gradient of animal impact. Applying phospholipid etherlipid analysis, the highest archaeal biomass was found in section severe impact (SI), followed by moderate impact (MI) and no impact. The same trend was observed for the methanogens as showed by real-time quantitative PCR analyses of methyl coenzyme M reductase (mcrA) genes. The detection of monounsaturated isoprenoid side chain hydrocarbons (i20:1) indicated the presence of acetoclastic methanogens in the cattle-impacted sites. This result was corroborated by the phylogenetic analysis of mcrA gene sequences obtained from section SI, which showed that 33% of the analysed clones belonged to the genus Methanosarcina. The majority of the sequenced clones (41%) showed close affiliations with uncultured rumen archaeons. This leads to the assumption that a substantial part of the methanogenic community in plot SI derived from the grazing cattle itself. Compared to the spring sampling, in autumn, a significant reduction in archaeal biomass and number of copies of mcrA genes was observed mainly for section MI. It can be concluded that after 5 months without cattle impact, the severely impact section maintained its methane production potential, whereas the methane production potential under moderate impact returned to background values.

J		Article		Stimulation of sulfate reduction rates in Mediterranean fish farm sediments inhabited by the seagrass Posidonia oceanica		Holmer, Marianne (holmer@biology.sdu.dk) ; Frederiksen, Morten S.									Biogeochemistry (Dordrecht)		2007	SEP 2007	85	2	169-184	169	184	English						Sulfate reduction rates and biogeochemical parameters of fish farm sediments across the Mediterranean were investigated in the order to evaluate the potential effects of organic matter inputs on habitat quality for the common seagrass Posidonia oceanica. Four study sites were selected in Spain, Italy, Greece and Cyprus to represent the Mediterranean basin. P. oceanica was found in immediate vicinity of all the farms, which were located at physically exposed sites about 1 km from the shore lines. Organic matter accumulation, sulfate reduction rates and sulfur pools were measured in depth profiles along transects from the farms in both bare and vegetated sediments. Results show that although the organic matter accumulation was minor at the sites (POC < 2.8% DW), the sulfate reduction rates were high, in particular at the largest farm in Italy ( up to 212 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), similar to rates found at shallower, temperate fish farm sites, where higher sedimentation rates can be expected. Sulfate reducing bacteria in these low-organic, carbonate-rich Mediterranean sediments respond strongly to organic matter loadings and cause habitat degradation. Sulfate reduction rates measured in the P. oceanica sediments were among the highest recorded (7.8-42.0 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) similar to rates found in degrading meadows impacted by organic matter loadings. As sulfate reduction rates were correlated with the sedimentation rates along the transects rather than organic matter pools this suggests mineralization processes were controlled by organic matter loading in fish farm sediments. The vegetated sediments near the net cages were more reduced due to accumulation of sulfides compared to control sites, which is a possible contributing factor to the observed seagrass decline in the farm surroundings. It is recommended that Mediterranean fish farms are placed in areas with rapid dispersal of particulate waste products to minimize organic matter loading of the sediments and thereby preserve habitat quality for benthic fauna and flora.

One method for recovering degraded soils in semiarid regions, is to add organic matter in order to improve soil characteristics, thereby enhancing biogeochemical nutrient cycles. In this study, the effect of adding the organic fraction of urban wastes (both fresh and composted) on different carbon fractions and on microbiological and biochemical parameters (microbial biomass C, basal respiration and different enzymatic activities) of a degraded soil of SE Spain has been assessed in a 2 year experiment. Three months after the addition of the organic material, spontaneous plant growth occurred and the plant cover lasted until the end of the experiment. Organic soil amendment initially increased the levels of soil organic matter, microbial biomass, basal respiration and some enzyme activities related to the C and N cycles. These values decreased but always remained higher than those of the unamended soil. The results indicate that the addition of urban organic waste is beneficial for recovering degraded soils, the microbial activity of which clearly increases with amendment. The incorporation of compost seemed to have a greater positive effect on the soil characteristics studied than the incorporation of fresh organic matter.

Communications in Agricultural and Applied Biological Sciences		2003		68	2A	163-166	163	166	English	print					In the Dolni Dubnik oil deposit, Northern Bulgaria, waters polluted with crude oil and heavy metals (iron, manganese, zinc, cadmium, lead, copper) were treated by means of a natural wetland located in the deposit. The waters had a pH in the range of about 4.5 - 6.5 and contained about 1-5 mg/l oil. The concentrations of heavy metals usually were about 2 - 4 times higher than the relevant permissible levels for waters intended for use in the agriculture and industry. The watercourse through the wetland covered a distance of about 100 m and the water flow rate varied in the range of about 0.2-0.8 l/s. The wetland was characterized by an abundant water and emergent vegetation and a diverse microflora, including different oil-degrading bacteria and fungi. The treatment of the polluted waters by means of the above-mentioned wetland markedly depended on the temperature but was efficient during the different climatic seasons, even during the cold winter months at temperatures close to 0degreeC. The oil content in the wetland effluents in most cases was decreased to less than 0.2 mg/l, and the concentrations of heavy metals were decreased below the relevant permissible levels. The removal of oil was connected with its microbial degradation. The removal of heavy metals was due to different processes but the microbial dissimilatory sulphate reduction and the sorption of metals on the organic matter and clay minerals present in the wetland played the main role.

Aquaculture		1997		149	1-2	1-14	1	14	English						Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), sea trout (S. trutta m. trutta) and brown trout (S. trutta m. lacustris) at four fish farms in northern Finland were examined in 1988-1992 for external lesions with filamentous bacteria. Phenotypic tests demonstrated that most of these bacteria were very similar to Flavobacterium johnsoniae. In two cases Flavobacterium columnare was isolated also. A total of 247 tanks (cases) with fish having external lesions containing filamentous bacteria were found, 57.5% of which contained only filamentous bacteria, while the rest had simultaneous non-filamentous bacterial or parasitic infection. In 31.6% of the cases more than 5% of the fish died in the course of the disease, but in 39.7% of the cases no mortality occurred or it was below 1%. The disease symptoms occurred on either the gills, jaws, skin, fins or tail, or on different combinations of these. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the significance of the site of the symptoms, fish species, fish age, rearing density, other simultaneous infections, water temperature and the farm for fish mortality in the cases with filamentous bacteria. The results indicated that water temperature, fish species, gill or jaw erosion and the farm itself had the greatest effects on mortality.	Rintamaki-Kinnunen, P.; Dep. Biol., Univ.

J		Article		Suitability of environmentally friendly vineyard management with the resistant grapevine cultivar 'Viktoria gyongye' in Hungary		Mikulas, Ildiko									Mitteilungen Klosterneuburg		2001		51	6	254-258	254	258	English	print					In a three-years' experiment the consequences of organic, integrated and pesticide-free production on quality and quantity of yield as well as phytosanitary parameters were investigated with the grape cultivar 'Viktoria gyongye'. In respect of infection by Plasmopara viticola on the leaves and bunches, as well as angular leaf scorch (Pseudopezicula tracheiphila), organic production with the application of sulphur, gave sufficient protection to the plants. The resistance of the cultivar was shown by the low degree of infection on grapes in spite of the high percentage of infected leaves or bunches. No positive effect of an intensive canopy management could be observed. Phytophagous mites in the organic and pesticide free plots were well controlled by the predatory mites, while the population of grape rust mite (Calepitrimerus vitis) rose considerably in the integrated plots. Grape erineum mite (Eriophyes vitis), on the other hand, could be better suppressed by the application of sulphur than by the help of predatory mites. The experiences gained during the experiment confirm the necessity to treat the cover crop flexibly to minimize competitive stress.

According to branches of economic activities occupational infectious diseases predominate in health professionals, in agricultural and forestry workers. Most diagnoses were diagnosed and notified in the East Bohemian region. Occupational diseases with an interhuman transmission account for 68%, zoonoses for 29% and tropical diseases for 3%. Among interhuman diseases predominate scabies, infectious hepatitis and tuberculosis, among zoonoses trichophytoses, erysipeloid and Lyme borreliosis. In tropical, subtropical or other climatically, hygienically and epidemiologically pretentious areas workers contract most often malaria, amoebiasis or infectious hepatitis type A.

Diseases of Aquatic Organisms		1995		22	1	25-32	25	32	English						Pancreas disease (PD) of farmed Atlantic salmon Salmo salar has been recognised in Scotland, Ireland, Norway, the USA, France and Spain and can cause severe economic loss. This paper reports the isolation, from PD-affected fish, of a virus with physicochemical characteristics and morphology resembling members of the Togaviridae. When inoculated into Atlantic salmon post-smolts it causes pathological changes in pancreas, heart and muscle tissues which are indistinguishable from those present in field outbreaks of PD. It is proposed that the virus be named salmon pancreas disease virus (SPDV).	Fish Dis. Unit, Vet. Sci. Div., Dep. Agric.

Moreover, historical sources (Floystrup 1920) made it possible to describe the Magpie population of Copenhagen tit the 1860s and during the years 1909-1919. Our survey area Was Outside tire town in 1860. but in 1909-1919 the Urban development wits almost completed. with housing blocks and streets covering the area except for a few parks and cemeteries.Before the urban development the Magpie was a common bird in the area. then consisting of park-like areas and. outside the city ramparts. of extensive farmland and large gardens with old trees. By 1909-1919 the Magpies had almost disappeared. even from the parks and cemeteries. In 1966, 39 apparently occupied nests (AONs) of Magpie were located in the survey area (5.4 per km(2): Fig. 1). In 1995, 287 AONs were found in the same area (40.0 per km(2): Fig. 2). And tit 2004, 133 AONs (55.8 per km(2)) were found in a 2.38 km(2) Subarea (Fig. 3) where. in 1995, 88 AONs had been counted (37.0 per km(2)).We believe that tire decline of tire Magpie population between 1860 and 1909 was it result of urban development. Almost all trees were probably cut down, reducing available nest sites. During the same period, the species seems to have been increasingly persecuted by humans. We do not know when Magpies began to re-occupy the area. Almost all pairs in 1966 nested in parks with tall trees. and the birds were very shy, but many pair have since established themselves in built-up areas with only few, scattered trees, and the birds have become much more tame (flight distance reduced from more than 50 in to only about 5 in). The increase in the Magpie population was apparently caused by a high survival rate (no shooting) combined with an increase of suitable nesting habitat; the tameness of the birds will have increased the latter trend, making even low trees and bushes available for nesting. The disappearance of the formerly preferred nesting tree, the elm Ulmus glabra, due to Dutch elm disease, had no negative effect on the size of the Magpie population, but led to the utilization of a wider range of nesting tree species in 2004 compared with 1995 (Table 1).

J		Article		Scrapie-rida in Iceland		Sigurdarson, Sigurdur									Norsk Veterinaertidsskrift		2000		112	5	408-413	408	413	Norwegian	print					We believe scrapie was imported to Iceland 120 years ago with one English ram. The disease was on its way to spread over the whole country in 1978. Then it was decided to stop the spreading, and in 1986 to eradicate the disease. We hope that we will be able to do this. The eradicationscheeme works. The country has been divided into 36 quarantine zones, many of them established fifty years ago. The last ten years scrapie has been found on farms located in seven areas. For more than ten years no spreeding has occured to new areas. Scrapie was diagnosed on 104 farms before 1986. Every sheep on known scrapie-farms was killed in the period 1978-1990, every new infected flock is killed as soon as possible and the premises desinfected thoroughly. The hay produced during the scrapie time is destroyed or sold for feeding of horses. We think that haymites might be vectors for scrapie agent and responsible for five percent reoccurence of scrapie. New cases of scrapie were 66 in the year of 1986, in 1990 they were 20, in 1995 we found scrapie on 12 new farms, in 1990 they were 20, in 1995 we found scrapie on 12 new farms and in the year of 1999 two new scrapie-farms were found.

Journal of Neurovirology		2000	April, 2000	6	2	137-144	137	144	English	print					Previous epidemiological evidence suggested that in some instances a vector and/or reservoir is involved in the occurrence and spread of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). In a preliminary study, hay mite preparations from five Icelandic farms with a history of scrapie were injected into mice, and some of these mice became sick after long incubation periods. To confirm that the disease was scrapie, subsequent passages in mice were performed. In addition, the characteristics of the disease process in these passages were assessed and the results compared to those findings with standard scrapie strains. As expected for scrapie, subsequent passages in the same host led to shortened incubation periods compared to those in primary isolate mice, and all mice had spongiform changes in brain. Results were similar for three of four isolates with regard to clinical manifestations, the incubation periods in mice of the three scrapie incubation-period genotypes (s7s7, s7p7, p7p7), and the PrPSc Western blot (WB) pattern. The characteristics of the fourth isolate were markedly different from the other three isolates with regard to these parameters. Comparison of the characteristics of standard mouse-adapted scrapie strains and the four isolates revealed differences; these differences were particularly pronounced for the fourth isolate.

J		Article		Infectious and parasitic illnesses in sea-bred fish		Vigneulle, Martine; Castric, J.; Baudin Laurencin, F.									Recueil de Medecine Veterinaire de l'Ecole d'Alfort		1994		170	2-3	111-120	111	120	French						Marine aquaculture in Europe is essentially concerned with salmonids and bass, turbot and gilthead species. Its expansion has been followed by the appearance of diverse pathologies, namely of an infectious or parasitic nature. Among the most common diseases are some which are more specific to the sea environment and are also seen in wild fish populations such as vibriosis caused by Vibrio anguillarum and certain parasitic infections (copepod infestation caused by Lepeophteirus salmonis). Other infections are equally rife in fresh water species such as viral haemorrhagic septicaemia, MRLC due to a rhabdovirus and furunculosis caused by Aeromonas salmonicida. In the last ten years new diseases have appeared (pasteurellsis caused by Pasteurella piscida, infectious anaemia of Atlantic salmon without a doubt of viral aetiology) while some dominant pathologies still persist. The losses they cause represent an important obstacle to the development of fish-farms, because at the present time the methods of control do not allow eradication.	Centre Natl.

C.; Elderson, Janneke; Kohl, Jurgen									European Journal of Plant Pathology		2007	MAR 2007	117	3	293-305	293	305	English						Winter carrot for the fresh market is an important cash crop for many organic arable farms in the Netherlands. In recent years carrot roots from cold stores have been affected by superficial dark brown to black spots. To gain insight into the pathogens causing the blemish and the effect of agronomic practices on their occurrence, surveys were carried out among crops harvested in 2001 and 2002. In addition carrots harvested in 2003 were screened for root spotting pathogens. Rhexocercosporidium carotae (syn. Acrothecium carotae and Pseudocercosporidium carotae) was the dominant pathogen in blackish spots on carrots harvested in 2001. On carrots harvested in 2002 and 2003 Alternaria radicina was detected more frequently. Multiple regression analysis indicated that a higher occurrence of the blemish may be linked with harvest conditions and presence of umbelliferous plants. The effect of the temperature on conidial germination, mycelial growth and pathogenicity of R. carotae was studied. The estimated optimum and maximum temperature for growth of R. carotae was 19 and 29 degrees C, respectively. Inoculation experiments demonstrated that wounds are good invasion routes. Infection occurred at 3, 10 and 20 degrees C, but not at 30 degrees C. Penetration into wounds was greatest at 20 degrees C.

South African Journal of Animal Science		2004		34	4	217-222	217	222	English						The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of dietary Supplementation with an essential oil mixture, a commercially available organic acid and a probiotic oil growth performance and carcass yield of broilers. One thousand two hundred and fifty sexed one day-old broiler chicks were randomly divided into five treatment groups of 250 birds each (negative control, organic acid, probiotic and essential oil mixture (EOM) at two levels). Each treatment group was further sub-divided into five replicates of 50 birds (25 male and 25 female) per replicate. The oil in the EOM was extracted from different herbs growing in Turkey. Ail organic acid at 2.5 g/kg diet, a probiotic at 1 g/kg diet and the EOM at 36 mg and 48 mg/kg diet were added to the basal diet of the birds. There were significant effects of dietary treatments oil body weight gain, feed intake, carcass yield and intestinal weight of the broiler at 42 days of age. At day 42, birds fed the diet containing 36 mg EOM/kg showed the highest body weight gain. This was followed by chicks on the diet containing 48 mg EOM/kg, the probiotic, the organic acid and the negative control, in descending order. The addition of the essential Oil Mixture to the diet improved the feed conversion ratio significantly as compared to the negative control and the organic acid treatment. The feed intakes at days 21 and 42 were significantly different between the treatments. The addition of 48 mg EOM/kg increased carcass yield significantly above the other treatments, while the addition of EOM and the organic acid reduced the intestinal weight significantly. It was Concluded that the Supplementation of the herbal essential Oil Mixture to broiler diet had beneficial effects oil body weight gain, feed conversion ratio and carcass yield.

Soils affected by recurring river overflowing, with Cr(III)-contaminated water and sediments, and a non-flooded control soil were analysed for microbial biomass, total and active fungal mycelium, enzyme activities (i.e., FDA hydrolase, dehydrogenase, beta-glucosidase, urease, arylsulphatase, acid phosphatase) and bacterial diversity (DGGE characterisation). Biological and biochemical data were related with both total and selected fractions of Cr and Cu (the latter deriving from agricultural chemical products) as well as with total and extractable organic C. The growth and activity of soil microbial community were influenced by soil organic C content rather than Cu or Cr contents. In fact, positive correlations between all studied parameters and organic C content were found. On the contrary, negative correlations were observed only between total fungal mycelium, dehydrogenase, arylsulphatase and acid phosphatase activities and only one Cr fraction (the soluble, exchangeable and carbonate bound). However, total Cr content negatively affected the eubacterial diversity but it did not determine changes in soil activity, probably because of the redundancy of functions within species of soil microbial community.On the other hand. expressing biological and biochemical parameters per unit of total organic C, Cu pollution negatively influenced microbial biomass, fungal mycelium and several enzyme activities, confirming soil organic matter is able to mask the negative effects of Cu on microbial community.

A long-term experiment established in 1922 on an Aquic Eutrocryepts in South-eastern Norway was chosen to investigate the effects of long-term fertilization on S fractions in bulk soil and those associated with aggregates. Chloroform fumigation-extraction was used to determine Microbial biomass S (MBS) and the wet chemical analysis method was used to fractionate soil S into ester S (hydriodic acid reducible S), carbon-bonded S (Raney nickel reducible S) and residual S (Raney nickel non-reducible S). High farmyard manure (FYM) application resulted in higher MBS in bulk soil than nitrogen + potassium (NK) application, but it did not differ significantly from the control. Application of FYM at 60 Mg ha(-1) resulted into accumulation of total S, total organic S and carbon-bonded Sin bulk soils, while mineral fertilizer (nitrogen+phosphorus+potassium+sulfur [NPKS] and NK) and the medium rate of FYM did not increase the accumulation of total S and organic S fractions. The macroaggregate sizes (> 2 and 1-2 mm) and the finest aggregate size (< 0.106 mm) showed significantly greater total S concentration than other aggregate sizes. Ester S and residual S were predominant organic S fractions and they accounted for 39 to 52% and 38 to 51% of the organic S, respectively. The macroaggregate sizes (> 2 and 1-2 mm) contained the highest ester S, but microaggregates (< 0.106 mm) exhibited higher carbon-bonded S and residual S than other aggregates. In conclusion, the accumulation of S was dependent on fertilizer type, the rate of FYM application and aggregate sizes.

(aaron@paris7.jussieu.fr)									Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry		2003	June 2003	376	4	431-435	431	435	English	print					For moderately hydrophobic compounds such as most pesticides adsorption on colloids (<0.2 mum) may play a key role in pesticide mobility as well as in their degradation by chemical and microbiological processes. However, until now, pesticide-organic colloid interactions are poorly understood. Quantitative data for sorption equilibria on colloids of two series of herbicides including triazines (atrazine, simazine, terbutylazine, prometryne, desethylatrazine, and desisopropylatrazine) and phenylureas (isoproturon, linuron, neburon, and diuron) sampled in the Seine river (urban zone) and the Marne river (agricultural zone) are presented. Partition coefficient of herbicides on colloids (Kcom), were evaluated by solid-phase extraction coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography-UV diode-array detection (SPE-HPLC-UV/DAD). In the case of triazines a satisfactory log-log correlation was found between Kcom and octanol-water coefficient (Kow) values. Phenylureas did not obey this correlation, with Kcom values being about two times higher than those of triazines. The existence of two distinct types of adsorption behaviour on colloids partly explains the different occurrence of triazines and phenylureas in surface waters.	Aaron, J.

For it, a screening site specific ecological risk assessment was conducted. Considering the presence of high levels of potentially toxic substances, such as metals and chlorinated organic compounds, aqueous and organic extracts were used to assess toxicity in sediments by using the photo-luminescent bacteria Vibrio fischeri (Microtox(R)) as screening response variable. Sediment samples collected during 2005-2006 in the last course of the Ebro River and its Delta have been analyzed. Toxic responses have shown strong relationships to the levels of pollutants in the area. Moreover, various sites presented some toxicity level, probably because of other factors associated with reducing environments into the sediments. Results indicate that Microtox(R) bioassay is an appropriate tool to perform risk assessment studies at screening level. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Pekka; Arneborn, Malin; Giesecke, Johan; Tegnell, Anders									Emerging Infectious Diseases		2002	September, 2002	8	9	956-960	956	960	English	print					A widespread outbreak of tularemia in Sweden in 2000 was investigated in a case-control study in which 270 reported cases of tularemia were compared with 438 controls. The outbreak affected parts of Sweden where tularemia had hitherto been rare, and these "emergent" areas were compared with the disease-endemic areas. Multivariate regression analysis showed mosquito bites to be the main risk factor, with an odds ratio (OR) of 8.8. Other risk factors were owning a cat (OR 2.5) and farm work (OR 3.2). Farming was a risk factor only in the disease-endemic area. Swollen lymph nodes and wound infections were more common in the emergent area, while pneumonia was more common in the disease-endemic area. Mosquito bites appear to be important in transmission of tularemia. The association between cat ownership and disease merits further investigation.

We were looking for a possible risk of infection associated with animal contacts. Investigation of the animal contacts of affected individuals led to the formulation of the hypothesis that animals are a source of cryptosporidiosis. The research was done in the Region of Ljubljana, an area with 587,000 inhabitants during a period of three years. Stool specimens of 338 persons with acute enteric diseases were positive for Cryptosporidium sp. Diagnosis was done with an immunofluorescence test and modified Ziel-Neelsen staining. Processing of statistical data was done with the medical software application EPI INFO 6. According to our questionnaire, direct contact with animals occurred in 49 of the 338 cases of cryptosporidiosis, and was more frequently registered in males (Odds ratio = 1.96). Subgenotyping analysis revealed the presence of two subgenotypes of Cryptosporidium parvum bovine (GPB and GPC) in humans. These data indicate that genetic heterogeneity in C. parvum bovine genotype exists in a localized area and that farm animals can be a source of infection.

J		Article		Surveillance- and control programmes for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in Norway		Hagen, Gunnar; Thorud, Kristin E.; Hoel, Kristian; Stovring, Merete									Norsk Veterinaertidsskrift		2000		112	5	381-385	381	385	Norwegian	print					This paper describes measures taken by the Norwegian Animal Health Authority to monitor transmissible spongiform encephalopathies and to control scrapie. Scrapie was first diagnosed in a Norwegian sheep in 1981. The disease has been confirmed in a total of 58 sheep herds in Norway. All affected herds have been killed. Rigorous measures have been enforced to eradicate the infectious agent from farms after the killing and destruction of the herd. Herds that have been in contact with a scrapie herd are subjected to official restrictions for a minimum period of five years. The number of scrapie cases increased markedly in 1995. Legislation was then enforced to reduce the risk of scrapie transmission between herds. A national surveillance- and control programme for scrapie was launched in 1997. The number of scrapie cases has been markedly reduced despite increased disease awareness and efforts to find potential suspect cases. The reduction in the number of scrapie cases can largely be explained by a special slaughter scheme for in-contact herds through 1996 and 1997. Active surveillance for BSE in accordance with an EU Commission Decision (98/272/EC) has been performed in Norway since August 1, 1998.

J		Article		[Microbiological quality of shellfish collected from coastal areas subjected to organic pollution of anthropic origin]	Qualita microbiologica dei molluschi bivalvi raccolti da aree marine costiere sottoposte ad inquinamento organico di origine antropica	Legnani, P.; Leoni, E.; Lev, D.; Rossi, R.; Villa, G. C.									Igiene Moderna		1999	Ottobre, 1999	112	4	1685-1699	1685	1699	Italian	print					An evaluation was made of the microbiological quality of shellfish (mussels and clams) collected along a 5 km stretch of marine coast subjected to a great amount of anthropic pollution (the Romagna coastline between S. Giuliano a Mare and Bellaria, province of Rimini). Samples of the same species of shellfish from authorised breeding areas were used as controls. The waters and sediments of the stretch of sea under examination were found to be affected by a uniform and extensive fecal contamination. According to the legal requirements (DL 131/92) they should therefore be considered unsuitable for shellfish-farming. The shellfish collected along the coast also showed a significantly higher level of fecal contamination (P < 0.01) than that of the controls, to the extent of not conforming to legal requirements (DL 131/92; DL 530/92). On account of this the harvesting of mussels and clams from the coast by the local population and tourists presents a risk for the transmission of the fecal-oral infectious diseases of which the shellfish are important vehicles.

NLVs cause >80% of the outbreaks of gastroenteritis reported to municipal public health centers and at least 5% of the cases of gastroenteritis for which a general practitioner is consulted. In addition, up to 18% of community cases of gastroenteritis in the 1998/1999 winter season have been attributed to NLVs. Patterns of disease activity differ remarkably, with "normal" years, when outbreaks occur that are caused by different types of NLV, and "epidemic" years, when outbreaks appear to be caused by a single strain. This observation suggests selection of antigenic variants with increased virulence or altered modes of transmission. In addition, since caliciviruses related to the NLVs from humans have been detected in stool specimens from calves at 45% of the dairy farms in The Netherlands, the possibility of spillover of epidemic strains from an animal reservoir to humans should be considered.

J	15482890	Article		Seroprevalence of Dictyocaulus viviparus in first grazing season calves in Sweden		Hoglund, Johan (johan.hoglund@sva.se) ; Viring, Sven; Tornqvist, Mats									Veterinary Parasitology		2004	November 10, 2004	125	3-4	343-352	343	352	English	print					A serological survey was carried out to determine the prevalence and geographical distribution of Dictyocaulus viviparus in calves after their first grazing season in Sweden. A total of 754 animals from 76 randomly selected herds in seven geographical regions were examined between September 24 and December 19, 2001. To get an indication about the geographical distribution of the infection 41 herds with beef-suckler calves were investigated. On each farm, blood was collected from 8 to 10 animals after an average of 26 24 days post-housing to determine specific IgG1 levels against a possible lungworm sperm antigen that-is highly specific against patent infections of D. viviparus. We also investigated the seroprevalence of, lungworm infection in relation to-cattle management. In one region additional samples were analysed from 35 herds either with: (a) beef-suckling, calves that were dewormed at housing, (b) untreated organically raised dairy calves, and finally from conventionally raised dairy calves either, (c) with or, (d) without a prophylactic anthelmintic treatment programme against gastrointestinal parasites on pasture. A questionnaire was used to obtain information about herd size and management, including measures to control nematode parasites on the farm. A total of 86 (11.8%) out of 754 animals had antibodies against D. viviparus, and at least one infected individual was detected in 30 (39.5%) of the 76 herds examined. Lungworm infected animals were found throughout the country and there was no significant differences between regions, although in southern and, southwestern Sweden 70.0% of the herds were infected. Furthermore, there were no major differences in the seroprevalence in relation to management. Between 40.0 and 44.4% of the herds were infected irrespective of management, with the exception of calves from organic herds where no seropositive samples were found (0%). This result is in contrast to previous findings of lungworms in Sweden, and indicates that the parasite status on organic farms is diverse. Copyright 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

C. M.; Wensvoort, G.; Verheijden, J. H. M.									Veterinary Microbiology		1997		56	1-2	21-32	21	32	English						To determine whether under Dutch field conditions PRRSV infection occurs in weaning pigs before the finishing period, a cross-sectional study was performed on 32 breeding farms to estimate the seroprevalence of antibodies directed against PRRSV in 4- to 5-week-old and 8- to 9-week-old pigs. Farms were visited twice within 5 months, and during each sampling an average of 20 sera were randomly collected from a unit of 4- to 5-week-old and a unit of 8- to 9-week-old pigs. The sera (n = 2568) were tested in the IDEXX-ELISA for the presence of antibodies directed against PRRSV. The seroprevalence of PRRSV in 4- to 5-week-old pigs and 8- to 9-week-old pigs varied between both samplings for each farm. The seroprevalence in the younger pigs was significantly higher than in the older pigs for both samplings (p lt 0.05), suggesting the presence of maternal antibodies. In addition, a longitudinal study was performed to evaluate the IDEXX-ELISA in detecting maternal antibodies directed against PRRSV and to determine the rate of decline of these antibodies in field sera. From serological results of eight litters, an average decay function was computed to quantify the maternal immunity to PRRSV. A seroprevalence in 8- to 9-weeks-old pigs of gtoreq 0.20 was calculated to indicate an active immune response to PRRSV. In the cross-sectional study in the pigs twenty-three percent of the units with 8- to 9-week-old pigs were considered to have an active serological response against PRRSV. We conclude that most Dutch pigs are seronegative for PRRSV at the start of the finishing period, since the results of this study showed that 77% of the units with 8- to 9-week-old pigs had a seroprevalence lt 0.20.

Blood samples were taken from 146 male and 3 female hunters from the provinces of Styria and Burgenland in the south-east of Austria and anamnestic data were obtained using a questionnaire. The serological investigations included the following bacterial, viral and parasitic zoonotic agents or zoonoses, respectively (antibody prevalence rates in brackets): borreliosis (IgG 42%, IgM 7%), brucellosis (1%), chlamydiosis (3%), ehrlichiosis (IgG 15%, IgM 3%), leptospirosis (10%), tularaemia (3%), Q fever (0%), encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV, 15%), Puumala-Hantavirus (10%), Newcastle Disease virus (4%), Echinococcus multilocularis/E. granulosus (5%/11%), toxocariasis (17%). Particularly striking in comparison with the control group and the veterinarians, farmers and slaughterhouse workers examined in earlier projects were the high seroprevalences to Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Ehrlichia spp., Leptospira interrogans, E. granulosus and E. multilocularis, encephalomyocarditis, Puumala-Hantavirus and Newcastle Disease virus as well as to Brucella abortus and Francisella tularensis. The present study indicates that hunters are especially exposed to zoonotic pathogens.

After the introduction of an active surveillance system, most countries in Europe have reported BSE cases in the cattle population. This indicates that the use of active surveillance in addition to passive surveillance is important to assess the true BSE status in a country. Scrapie, a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) in sheep and goats, has been reported in countries throughout the world with a few notable exceptions. Concern was expressed that BSE could have been introduced into sheep and goats. Currently, distinguishing between scrapie and BSE in small ruminants is only possible through lengthy experiments in mice. Preliminary results of active surveillance, introduced in 2002, show that significant underreporting occurred. The history of BSE in cattle shows that risk assessments concerning the risk in a given country were often ignored and subsequent risk management decisions were inaccurate, i.e. although the risk was probable, no measures were taken in terms of either animal or human health. Furthermore, the effect of the measures taken was often overestimated and these had to be amended several times. The most important action to prevent new cases of TSEs occurring is by banning the feeding meat-and-bone meal (MBM) to ruminants. Further measures to be considered are the exclusion of specified risk material and carcasses from rendering, the process parameters for rendering of animal waste and the prevention of cross-contamination of feed with MBM. The most important measures to protect the consumer are the ban on specified risk material, such as brain and spinal cord, which may contain particularly high concentrations of the BSE agent, and the ban on mechanically recovered meat. The most important measures taken in Europe and the scientific background thereof are described and discussed.

J		Article		The first pasteurellosis case in cultured sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.) at low marine water temperatures in Turkey		Korun, Jale (jalekorun@yahoo.com) ; Timur, Gulsen									Israeli Journal of Aquaculture Bamidgeh		2005	SEP 2005	57	3	197-206	197	206	English						The first observed pasteurellosis outbreak at a low marine water temperature (18-19 degrees C) is hereby reported. The disease was identified in three sea bass farms in the Aegean near Bodrum, Turkey. Diseased fish, Dicentrarchus labrax (L.), were characterized by lethargy, loss of appetite, darkened skin color, exophthalmia, abdominal swelling, pale gills, and hemorrhages over the operculum and ventral part of the body. Some diseased fish had hemorrhages on the head and opaque eyes. There were whitish nodules in the liver, the spleen varied in size (0.5-4 mm), and both organs were pale. Morphological, physiological, and conventional biochemical tests were used to determine the phenotypic properties of pure cultures of isolated colonies in samples taken from internal organs. Mono-Pp agglutination kit and API 20E were used to confirm the identified bacteria. The isolated strain was Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida. The sensitivity of the Aquarapid-Pp kit, which produced positive results in all diseased fish, was 0.91 and the specificity was 0.95. The principal histological changes were depletion of hemopoietic tissue and multiple round small or large necrotic and lytic areas in the spleen, vacuole degeneration and diffuse hemorrhagie in the liver, and peritubular vacuole degeneration and tubular necrosis in the kidney. Treatment with flumequine in the feed at 50 mg/kg body weight/day for seven days controlled mortality.

J		Article	Literature Review	The restoration and re-creation of species-rich lowland grassland on land formerly managed for intensive agriculture in the UK		Walker, Kevin J. (kwal@ceh.ac.uk) ; Stevens, Paul A.; Stevens, David P.; Mountford, J. Owen; Manchester, Sarah J.; Pywell, Richard F.									Biological Conservation		2004	September 2004	119	1	1-18	1	18	English	print					Intensive agriculture has resulted in the loss of biodiversity and the specialist flora and fauna associated with the semi-natural grasslands of low-intensity pastoral systems throughout northwest Europe. Techniques employed to restore and re-create these grasslands on agricultural land in the UK are reviewed. Extensive cutting and grazing management have been shown to diversify improved swards and facilitate re-colonisation on ex-arable soils, although rates of re-assembly of plant communities with affinity to existing semi-natural grasslands have generally been slow. On former agriculturally improved swards, nutrient depletion has accelerated this process, especially where "gaps" for establishment have been created. Similarly, on ex-arable soils "nutrient stripping" and sowing with diverse seed mixtures has led to the rapid development of species-rich swards. On free draining brown earths such an approach may be required to restore grassland communities where soil phosphorous concentrations exceed semi-natural levels by more than 10 mg/l (using Olsen's bicarbonate extractant). However, the appropriateness of this threshold for other soil types requires further sampling. Although restored grasslands are likely to contribute to national biodiversity targets success will ultimately depend on the reinstatement of the communities and ecological functions of semi-natural references. Although this is technically feasible for a few plant assemblages, less is known about the re-assembly of microbial and faunal communities, or the importance of trophic interactions during grassland succession. As a consequence, more research is required on the functional attributes of semi-natural grasslands, as well as the methods required to restore localised types, novel nutrient depletion techniques, the "phased" introduction of desirable but poor-performing species and the performance of different genotypes during grassland restoration.

Journal of Fish Diseases		2000	Jan., 2000	23	1	61-70	61	70	English	print					The present authors report the first description of a bacterial disease, Varracalbmi, recorded sporadically among seawater-reared Atlantic salmon in northern Norway between 1989 and early 1992. The causative organism, a Gram-negative, non-motile, capsule-forming, oxidase-positive and facultatively anaerobic rod, has not previously been described. The mean water temperatures during the outbreaks varied from 2.5 to 8 degreeC. The disease was characterized by haemorrhagic and necrotizing pyogranulomatous inflammation which targeted the eye and resulted in panophthalmitis. Accompanying lesions included deep dermal ulcerations, necrotizing and haemorrhagic pyogranulomatous lesions in the visceral organs, and necrosis of the pseudobranch. The proposed name of the disease, Varracalbmi, is the Lappish name for 'bloody eye'.	Ferguson, H.

J		Article		RETROSPECTIVE OF THE 1988 EUROPEAN SEAL EPIZOOTIC		HEIDE-JORGENSEN M-P; HARKONEN T; DIETZ R; THOMPSON P M									Diseases of Aquatic Organisms		1992		13	1	37-62	37	62	English						The disease that killed more than 18,000 harbour seals Phoca vitulina and a small number of grey seals Halichoerus grypus in the North Sea, the Kattegat-Skagerrak and the southern Baltic in 1988 has now been well described for all afflicted areas, and the pathological and virological findings are in good concordance from all seal groups studied. The descriptions vary in detail but render little doubt that the disease had identical characteristics, and that a newly recognized virus, phocine distemper virus (PDV), of the genus Morbillivirus, was the primary cause of the disease. A number of viral and bacterial agents as well as parasites were identified in the dead seals, but none of them seem to be of primary importance for the development of the disease syndrome. The high mortality can probably be explained by the fact that a highly pathogenic virus was introduced into a naive population with no specific immunity to the infectious agent. It is also possible that factors such as organochlorine pollution or crowding of seals at haul-out sites may have exacerbated the impact of the disease in some areas. However, there are currently insufficient data to determine the potential role of these other factors in the severity of the outbreak. Antibodies to infections by canine distemper virus (CDV)-like viruses are present in both North Atlantic and Antarctic pinnipeds, but the immunological response is usually distinct from that to PDV. The pathogenicity of these infections is unknown, but likely less than for the virus that infected North Sea harbour seals in 1988. However, harp seals Phoca groenlandica are frequently infected by PDV and they have recently invaded the North Sea wehre they have been observed in the vicinity of harbour seal haul-out sites. Hence, migrating harp seals are a plausible vector of the virus. PDV has been transmitted to terrestrial carnivores causing distemper outbreaks in Danish farmed mink Mustela vison in 1989, and an epizootiological link cannot be excluded. There are no epizootiological links between the seal epizootic in North Western Europe in 1988-89 and the disease outbreaks in Baikal Seals Phoca sibirica and high Arctic sled dogs in 1987-88.

The three-year (2005-08) EU-funded BORASSUS Project (Contract Number INCO-CT-2005-510745) is evaluating their long-term effectiveness in controlling soil erosion and assessing their sustainability and economic viability. These studies are in progress in 10 countries, both in the 'industrial north' (in Europe) and in the 'developing south' (Africa, South America and South-East Asia). This paper focuses on agro-environmental applications and potential in the 'developing south' (The Gambia, South Africa, Brazil, China, Thailand and Vietnam). Biogeotextiles offer potentially novel bioengineering solutions to environmental problems, including technologies for soil conservation, sustainable plant production and use of indigenous plants, improved ecosystem management, decreasing deforestation, improving agroforestry and cost-effective geotextile applications in diverse environments. Biogeotextiles may provide socio-economic platforms for sustainable development and the benefits for developing countries may include poverty alleviation, engagement of local people as stakeholders, employment for disadvantaged groups, small and medium enterprise (SME) development, earning hard currency, environmental education and local community involvement in land reclamation and environmental education programmes. These benefits are achieved through: (a) promotion of sustainable and environmentally-friendly palm agriculture to discourage deforestation, promoting both reforestation and agroforestry; (b) construction of palm geotextiles enabling development of a rural labour-intensive industry, particularly encouraging employment of socially-disadvantaged groups and (c) export of palm geotextiles to industrialized countries could earn hard currency for developing economies, based on the principles of fair trade.

J		Article		Modelling oyster population dynamics in a Mediterranean coastal lagoon (Thau, France): Sensitivity of marketable production to environmental conditions.		Gangnery, Aline (agangner@ifremer.fr) ; Bacher, Cedric; Buestel, Dominique									Aquaculture		2004	16 February, 2004	230	1-4	323-347	323	347	English	print					A population dynamics model was used to simulate variations in the standing stock of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, to assess the marketable production in Thau Lagoon (France) and to evaluate the sensitivity of this production to environmental conditions. The model is based on a continuous equation of the oyster abundance as a function of individual growth rate, inter-individual growth variability and mortality rate. The growth model depends on water temperature, particulate organic matter concentration and total individual mass. Inter-individual growth variability was introduced into the general population dynamics equation by a diffusion coefficient K that was set to 0.05. The population dynamics model took into account the two culture methods (i.e. "collees" and "pignes" oysters) and rearing strategies of oyster farmers by using timetables of seeding and harvesting obtained through interviews of oyster farmers. Distributions of standing stocks were obtained through assessments conducted in the lagoon in March 2000, October 2000 and March 2001 and were used to calibrate the model. The model estimated the total marketable production at ca. 17,900 t between March 2000 and March 2001. The major part of the production (ca. 70%) was in spring. Seventy percent of the annual production came from "collees" oysters. Sensitivity analyses showed that the key parameters are those related to harvesting. The model was used to evaluate the effects of different environmental conditions (e.g. a decrease in the oyster growth rate, a harvesting closure due a toxic algae bloom, a massive summer mortality due to an anoxic crisis) on short- and long-term variations in the standing stock and the production for both culture methods. A decrease in the growth rate of ca. 20% resulted in losses of 18% in the first year of production for both culture methods. Long-term simulations showed that the production of "pignes" oysters was more affected than that of the "collees" oysters (reductions of 26% and 4%, respectively). Simulated scenarios included a 2-month long harvesting closure (i.e. November and December) or a massive summer mortality (i.e. 45% and 20% for "collees" and "pignes" oysters, respectively). No long-term effect was predicted for either event, although losses of ca. 10% were estimated in the first year of production for both culture techniques. The model can be a useful tool for predicting marketable production of oysters as a function of rearing strategy and environmental conditions.

Game & Wildlife Science		2004	DEC 2004	21	4, Sp. Iss. SI	513-528	513	528	French						In France, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, Fish and Rural Affairs and the National Hunting and Wildlife Agency have become increasingly concerned with the risk that wildlife could constitute to the health of reared animals and man. In this matter, the wild boar, Sus scrofa, has become a subject of special attention because it can be a reservoir of several infectious or parasitic diseases, which are very important from an economic or public-health point of view, and because open-air pig breeding provides chances of contact between pigs and wild boars. The epidemiological survey of wild boar diseases is carried out by several networks and programmes. The SAGIR network follows the main causes of wildlife mortality. Each year the national programme for the serological survey of the wild boar population tests hunted wild boars for Classical Swine Fever (PPC), Aujesky Disease (MA), brucellosis and trichinellosis. The other survey programmes are local, like the survey programme for tuberculosis in wild ungulates. Wild-boar numbers are annually estimated by the correspondents of the "Cervids-Wild boar" network, which collect annual bags. Between 1973 and 2001 harvesting increased continuously (400% between 1989 and 2001) and in 2001 400,000 units have been harvested. At :the same time, open-air pig breeding numbers increased and also the number; of contacts between pigs and wild boars due to the lack of efficient measures of breeding protection, especially in central and west-central France. In the wild-boar populations since 1992 the PPC has been confined in the North-East of France where the disease is enzootic, the MA virus is circulating silently, the Brucella suis 2 infection is extremely widespread in France, with very high prevalence rates, the Trichinella infestation seems to be more important than that indicated by the official trichinoscopic verifications, and wild boar is infected by Mycobacterium bovis, the bovine tuberculosis agent, in several departements as are red deer, Cervus elaphus. Sanitary management measures are being implemented in France to avoid the development of these diseases in the wild boar populations and their transmission to domestic animals and man.

W.; Holtslag, J. B.; Bouma, A.; Koch, G.									Avian Diseases		2007		51	1, Suppl. S	304-308	304	308	English						Daily within-flock mortality data, from a few days before until a few days after onset of increased mortality, from H7N7-infected flocks were analyzed with nonlinear regression for layer (organic and free-range or caged), broiler, and turkey flocks. The following notification thresholds were recommended for the Netherlands: 1) organic layer flocks, broiler flocks, and turkey flocks <= 11 wk of age: >= 0.5% mortality/day for two consecutive days; 2) layer flocks with birds housed in cages: >= 0.25% mortality/day for two consecutive days; 3) turkey flocks >= 16 wk of age: >= 1% mortality/day for two consecutive days. Notification of increased mortality to the veterinary authorities should take place on the second day of increased mortality. Interpretation of mortality thresholds should be on the level of the poultry barn in which clinical problems arise. Because of nonoptimal specificity of proposed thresholds (mortality possibly caused by other diseases), use of PCR-diagnostics (results within 24 hr) without costs to the individual farmer should be promoted to exclude avian influenza in suspect clinical situations in order to minimize negative economic consequence for farmers and stimulate notification by farmers and veterinary practitioners.

J		Article		The effect of reduced tillage on nitrogen dynamics in silt loam soils		D'Haene, Karoline (Karoline.DHaene@ILVO.Vlaanderen.be) ; Vandenbruwane, Jeroen; De Neve, Stefaan; Gabriels, Donald; Salomez, Joost; Hofman, Georges									European Journal of Agronomy		2008	APR 2008	28	3	449-460	449	460	English						Crop rotations in Western Europe contain crops that seem not suitable for reduced tillage (RT) agriculture because they often include beets and potatoes, resulting in a high disturbance of the soil at the formation of the ridges and at harvest. Therefore, the short- and long-term effects of RT on the stratification and stock of total nitrogen (TN) in the 0-40 cm depth layer and the nitrogen (N) mineralization in the upper 15 cm depth layer of silt loam soils was evaluated. For doing so, 10 fields at seven locations representing the important types of RT systems in Belgium, applied for a different number of years, and eight fields under conventional tillage (CT) with comparable soil type and crop rotation were selected. Despite the presence of root and tuber crops in these rotations, the stratification of the percentage of TN and of the carbon to nitrogen ratio was more pronounced under RT than CT fields. The TN stock in the RT fields worked with a cultivator or soil loosener was comparable to CT fields, even after 20 years. No trend could be found in the change in TN stock of reduced tillage by direct drilling compared to CT. The N mineralization rate in undisturbed soil cores under controlled conditions in the laboratory was on average 0.20 +/- 0.08 mg N kg(-1) dry soil day(-1) for RT fields compared to an average of 0.13 +/- 0.05 mg N kg(-1) dry soil day(-1) for CT fields. This increase in N mineralization rate was correlated with a higher microbial biomass nitrogen content. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J		Article		Genetic structure of natural populations of Agaricus bisporus, the commercial button mushroom		Xu, J.; Kerrigan, R. W.; Callac, P.; Horgen, P. A.; Anderson, J. B.									Journal of Heredity		1997	Nov.-Dec., 1997	88	6	482-488	482	488	English	print					Agaricus bisporus (Lange) Imbach, the familiar button mushroom of commerce, is a major vegetable crop around the world. In the past 10 years a significant worldwide effort has been made to collect Agaricus germ plasm from the wild. Here we report the genetic analysis of a collection of 342 isolates from 12 locations. For 10 nuclear loci marked by RFLPs, we found high genetic diversity in all geographic populations. Among the 342 isolates, three different analyses of genetic diversity were carried out: the first on the total sample of 342 isolates, the second on a subset of 108 "cultivar-like" isolates shown previously to carry either of the two mitochondrial DNA haplotypes found in cultivated strains, and the third on the other 234 isolates that carry a diversity of mtDNA haplotypes not found in cultivated strains. We found that the samples of cultivar-like isolates from various locations were genetically more similar among themselves and to the cultivars than to the samples of other isolates from the same locations. Furthermore, the cultivar-like samples showed no evidence of genetic differentiation between continents and between regions within a continent. In contrast, samples of other isolates showed significant differentiation at the same levels of the geographic hierarchy. A comparison of gene frequencies was consistent with the occurrence of hybridization between the cultivar-like and the other strains in the coastal California population. Analyses of genetic diversity and genetic distance were all consistent with the historical record that cultivars and cultivar-like strains in the wild originated from Western Europe.

Biosecurity is considered the most important tool to prevent and In certain areas of the world, AI has become endemic and the control AI. recent outbreaks in Europe and Africa show that the epidemiological situation is evolving in an unprecedented way. The consequences of this situation are economic losses to the poultry industry, food security issues in developing countries and a serious threat to human health, due to the direct consequences of AI infection in humans, and more alarmingly due to the risk of the generation of a new pandemic virus from the animal reservoir. In this paper, the physical and chemical methods of inactivating AI viruses are reviewed, with particular emphasis on the practicalities of using such methods in the poultry industry.

Chemical determination of OA in mussels by homogenization of the hepatopancreas, extraction, purification, reaction with 9-anthryldiazomethane (ADAM). HPLC-separation, and fluorometric quantification has been used for weekly monitoring of mussel growing farms and to control harvested mussels. Within a week, substantial rises (from 0.41 to 5.4 .mu.g OA/g hepatopancreas) as well as great reductions (from 7.2 to 1.8 .mu.g/g hepatopancreas) were recorded. The rapid rise implies that weekly sampling is not sufficient to ensure that mussels are free from toxic levels of OA. The rapid decrease reveals that efficient toxin clearance mechanisms exist in the mussels. Substantial OA clearance occurs also at low temperatures (1.4-3.degree. C). Within a mussel growing site the OA concentrations could differ considerably between adjacent mussels (0.63 and 4.2 .mu.g OA/g hepatop.) and even more between mussles grown at different depths along the same rope (0.63 and 10 .mu.g OA/g hepatop.) These data emphasize the importance of sampling studies on DST in mussels. Great differences between the different mussel growing sites were also observed. These data have been discussed with respect to the spread of the toxin by the sea, and the possibilities of reducing the exposure of the mussels to the toxic algae.

J		Article		Reduction of the content of organic micropollutants in digested sludge by a post-aeration process: A full-scale demonstration		Knudsen, L.; Kristensen, G. H.; Jorgensen, P. E.; Jepsen, S.-E.									Water Science and Technology		2000		42	9	111-118	111	118	English	print					Surplus wastewater sludge reused for agricultural purposes must observe certain limit values with respect to different xenobiotic substances. The latest revision of the statutory order in Denmark includes for the first time a list of limit values on organic micropollutants in sludge. Four groups of micropollutants are included in the list (LAS, PAH, NPE, and DEHP). The limit values will be revised in June 2000, at which time up to 50% of the sludge used for agricultural purposes, will not comply with the standards. It has been observed that the level of organic micropollutants is much higher in anaerobically digested sludge than in aerobically stabilised sludge. This indicates that the organic micropollutants in question can be partly or fully degraded under aerobic conditions but not under anaerobic conditions. The observations have formed the basis of the development of a post-aeration process for biological degradation of organic micropollutants in anaerobically digested sludge with the aim of enabling continued reuse of the sludge for agricultural purposes. The process is presented in this paper together with a description of a full scale demonstration experience on a Danish wastewater treatment plant.

The first survey involved 4-12-day-old calves in six dairy-calf distribution centres, collecting calves from seven Administrative Regions (Aquitaine, Bretagne, Franche-Comte, Lorraine, Normandie, Nord, Pays de Loire). For each region, 20 calves were selected every month for 12 consecutive months (October 1995-September 1996). Prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection was 17.9% (Confidence Intervals (C.I.) 95%=(16.1%; 19.8%)) among the 1628 selected calves, of which only 5.3% had diarrhoea. The second survey conducted between November 1995 and May 1996 involved 4-21-day-old calves examined by veterinary practitioners who selected 189 livestock farms of dairy- or suckler-type in ten Administrative Departments (Allier, Cantal, Creuse, Doubs, Ille-et-Vilaine, Maine-et-Loire, Manche, Pas-de-Calais, Saone-et-Loire, Vendee). Cryptosporidia were detected in 105 (55.6%) of the farms. Among the 440 calves examined, of which 398 (90.5%) presented diarrhoea, cryptosporidia were found in 191 animals, i.e. a prevalence of 43.4% (C.I. 95%=(38.8%; 48.0%)). Breed of calves and type of housing had very little impact on prevalence in this survey. Some regional variations could be noticed, even if cryptosporidia infection is widespread. Monthly variations could be related to seasonal peaks in calving with a lower infection rate during summer.

Total coliform and Escherichia coli concentration, presence of helminth eggs and Salmonella, and physical-chemical parameters were evaluated in raw and treated wastewater. Chemical and biochemical oxygen demand removal efficiency was 74.6 and 77.9%, respectively. As for organic nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total suspended solids, total efficiency removal was 17.4, 12.5, and 32.9%, respectively. The average density of total coliforms and E. coli was 3.5 x 10(9) and 1.8 x 10(8) MPN/100 mL and 1.1 x 10(7) MPN/100 mL and 3.9 x 10(5) MPN/100 mL for raw and treated wastewater, respectively. Ascaris eggs were observed in 80.8% of the samples collected, and viable eggs in 42.3% of the samples. Salmonella was detected in 36.4% of the samples. The values observed in treated wastewater did not show the adequate bacteriological quality, as recommended by World Health Organization (Geneva, Switzerland). Therefore, additional measures should be taken to achieve an improved microbiological and parasitological quality.	Pivelli, R.

Applied and Environmental Microbiology		1996		62	2	552-563	552	563	English						The broad-spectrum antibiotic 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (PHL) is a major determinant in the biological control of a range of plant pathogens by many fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. A 4.8-kb chromosomal DNA region from Pseudomonas fluorescens Q2-87, carrying PHL biosynthetic genes, was used as a probe to determine if the PHL biosynthetic locus is conserved within PHL-producing Pseudomonas strains of worldwide origin. The phl gene probe hybridized with the genomic DNA of all 45 PHL-producing Pseudomonas strains tested, including well-characterized biocontrol strains from the United States and Europe and strains isolated from disease-suppressive soils from Switzerland, Washington, Italy, and Ghana. The PHL producers displayed considerable phenotypic and genotypic diversity. Two phenotypically distinct groups were detected. The first produced PHL, pyoluteorin, and hydrogen cyanide and consisted of 13 strains from almost all locations sampled in the United States, Europe, and Africa. The second produced only PHL and HCN and consisted of 32 strains from the U.S. and European soils. Analysis of restriction patterns of genomic DNA obtained after hybridization with the phi gene probe and cluster analysis of restriction patterns of amplified DNA coding for 16S rRNA (ARDRA) and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers indicated that the strains that produced both PHL and pyoluteorin were genetically highly similar. In contrast. there was more diversity at the genotypic level in the strains that produced PHL but not pyoluteorin. ARDRA analysis of these strains indicated two clusters which, on the basis of RAPD analysis, split into several subgroups with additional polymorphisms. In general, the occurrence of phenotypically and genotypically similar groups of PHL producers did not correlate with the geographic origin of the isolates, and highly similar strains could be isolated from diverse locations worldwide.

J		Article		European salt marshes diversity and functioning: The case study of the Mont Saint-Michel bay, France		Lefeuvre, Jean-Claude; Bouchard, Virginie; Feunteun, Eric; Grare, Sonia; Laffaille, Pascal; Radureau, Alain									Wetlands Ecology and Management		2000	June, 2000	8	2-3	147-161	147	161	English	print					The macrotidal Mont Saint-Michel bay has been studied intensively since 1990. The objectives of this study, supported by the European Union, was to understand various processes underlying the functioning of this hydro-system with a special focus on organic matter and nutrient fluxes between saltmarshes and marine waters. This paper presents a synopsis of these studies. The tidal flats are unvegetated and primary production is exclusively due to microphytobenthos communities dominated by diatoms. Halophile plant communities colonize the top parts of the tidal flats. Their composition and production vary according to a maturity gradient and sheep grazing. In ungrazed saltmashes, production ranged from 1080 gDW m-2cntdotyr-1 in the lower marsh to 1990 gDW m-2cntdotyr-1 in the upper marsh whereas it was only 200 to 500 gDW m-2cntdotyr-1 in Salicornia spp. dominated pioneer zones and sheep grazed areas. Most of this organic matter (OM) was trapped in situ, processed by fungi and bacteria, and then released seaward via tidal fluxes, groundwater and runoff as particulate OM and nutrients: -497 kg N, -1200/-1000 kg P-PO4 and -9900/-4200 kg inorganic carbon). A small amount of OM was exported to the bay as macrodetritus. Fatty acids and stable isotopes, used as markers, showed that OM produced by the marsh halophytes contributed to the diet of all the tidal flats invertebrates that were studied. Transient fish species were shown to colonize the saltmarshes to forage or graze, exporting about 50 tons POM (DW)cntdoty-1. Therefore, it is assumed that the saltmarsh production enhances the production of the whole bay. But the functioning is still poorly known because the nutrient sinks have not all been identified. Part of the nutrients input was provided by precipitation (+327 kg y-1), but the contribution of the catchments was not quantified despite the fact that their influence was shown by the presence of lindane in all the compartments of the system. Dynamics of saltmarshes are mainly influenced by natural sedimentation (1.5 million m3cntdoty-1 in the bay), plant community succession, and management (i.e., reclamation and agricultural activities).

J		Article		Separation methods for the concentration of picoplankton		Ambrozova, Jana									Archiv fuer Hydrobiologie Supplement		2001	April, 2001	137		129-135	129	135	English	print					Populations of Synechococcus capitatus, a small cyanobacterium, have been studied in the Janov Reservoir, situated in the Most district of the Czech Republic, since 1997. Untreated water from this basin is used for the drinking water, after treatment in the Janov water works. The investigation of this species was part of a research project supported by the Czech Ministry of Agriculture in Prague, "Toxicological evaluation of microorganisms causing the problems in the technology of water treatment." Three methods were used in the isolation and concentration of S. capitatus: differential filtration, temperature stratification and dissolved air flotation. This step is done so to obtain enough biomass of this picoplanktic species for use in acute and chronic toxicity bioassays. Differential filtration produced and concentrated material in which 90% of the biomass was composed of S. capitatus. The influence of water temperature stratification on the occurrence and reproduction of S. capitatus was tested under laboratory conditions. Reproduction of this species occurs in a temperature of 12,0-16,5 degreeC. Finally, the dissolved air flotation method was able to successfully separate and concentrate 85% of the biological material. This process, which has been patented in the Czech Republic, can be used in water treatment facilities with a low chance of coagulation.

J		Article		Eutrophication: An ecological vision		Khan, Fareed A.; Ansari, Abid Ali									Botanical Review		2005	DEC 2005	71	4	449-482	449	482	English						The present review deals with the studies conducted on the impact of phosphorus on growth of aquatic plants causing eutrophication in well-known water bodies the world over. The review covers the definition and concept of eutrophication and the adverse effects on quality and ecosystem functioning. The eutrophication of several water bodies leads to significant changes in the structure and function of the aquatic ecosystem. Several activities of human interest, including navigation and power generation, are hampered. A large number of lakes in the United States, Europe, and Asia have recently been found to be highly eutrophic. Water, the precious fluid, is not uniformly distributed throughout the surface of the earth. Most of the water bodies world over are surrounded with densely populated human settlement areas and agricultural fields. The size of smaller water bodies in human settlement areas is on the decrease with rise in population. After treatment, a large quantity of sewage from the households is regularly discharged into the water bodies. The runoff brings down fertilizers and other chemicals from agricultural fields. The phosphor-us contained in these effluents is known to promote excessive growth of plants. This review is an account of the role, sources, and monitoring of phosphorus, as well as its cycle. The natural phosphorus cycle originating from the weathering of phosphate rock is now a two-way operation, due to significant addition of phosphorus from anthropogenic sources.The detergents that are the major source of phosphorus inputs into water bodies (through sewage and drainage systems) have been thoroughly discussed. The major part of detergents comprises builders containing polyphosphate salts. An environment-friendly and effective synthetic builder is yet to be developed to replace existing phosphorus containing builders of detergents. The utility of the alternative builders available has been reviewed. Nitrogen has also been reported to affect the phytoplankton production in eutrophic waters in temperate regions. Several environmental factors have also been found to add to the problem of eutrophication in addition to nutrients. Several limiting factors-namely, CO, level, temperature, pH, light, and dissolved oxygen-are known to affect eutrophic water bodies. Eutrophication not only results in algal bloom but also affects wetland plants and activates early onset of natural succession at a relatively faster rate. Some of the plant species reported and studied world over are the best indicators of the level of eutrophication. The studies on the change in structure, function, and diversity of the ecosystem have been used as parameters to assess the level of eutrophication. In several countries adequate control measures have been adopted in to control eutrophication. But these measures were found to be only partially effective in controlling the phosphorus unloading in water bodies. In this review some control measures are suggested, with emphasis on biological control. The review concludes by taking into account the ecological prospective of the water-the precious fluid and a basis of life on the earth.

Journal of Applied Microbiology		2003		94	5	919-928	919	928	English	print					Aims: To determine a temperature-humidity-time treatment that eliminates Salmonella and Escherichia coli in substrates representing organic matter in poorly cleaned poultry houses, i.e. worst case scenario laboratory tests. Methods and Results: Organic matter (poultry faeces and feed) in a 2.5-cm layer was inoculated with 2 X 105-3 X 106 Salmonella g-1, left undried or dried at ca. 30% relative humidity (RH) during a 10-day period, and temperature increased at 1degreeC h-1 to the final heating temperature of 50, 55, 60, 65 or 70degreeC and held at 16-30 or 100% RH. All samples were tested for Salmonella according to predetermined sampling time schedules and faecal samples were also tested for naturally occurring E. coli. Overall, humidity was an important factor in the elimination of Salmonella and E. coli. Results for recovery of Salmonella and E. coli were highly associated. Conclusions: The application of gtoreq60degreeC and 100% RH during a 24-h period eliminated Salmonella and E. coli in all samples. Escherichia coli could be used as an indicator bacterium for the elimination of Salmonella. Significance and Impact of the Study: The results from worst case scenario laboratory tests could be applied in steam heating of persistently Salmonella-infected poultry houses. The use of E. coli as an indicator bacterium for the validation of Salmonella results should be considered.	Gradel, K.

Considerable differences in the species composition of fungi communities were found related both to the type of soil (period of lying barren) and treatment. Before the treatment the soil was dominated by such species as Paecilomyces lilacinus, P. marquandi, Apiospora montagnei, Pseudogumnoscus roseus, Penicillium janczewskii, P. jensenii, while after a year following addition of sawdust by Trichoderma harzianum, T. pubescens, T. virens and numerous species of Penicillium. The presence of Trichoderma species, comprising over 60% of the communities after the treatment indicated the possibility of creating conditions for efficient protective action against root infection of trees by Heterobasidion annosum (a cause of dangerous destruction in forests growing on post agricultural land in Poland).

Epidemiology and Infection		2005	APR 2005	133	2	359-366	359	366	English						Faecal samples of 2660 domestic animals from 116 farms and 956 samples of food were examined for the presence of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). STEC was recovered from 126 (15.3%) cattle, 135 (11.3%) pigs, 135 (66.8%) sheep, 31 (73.8%) goats, 4 (1 %) chicken, and 15 (1.6 %) food samples. Of all STEC isolates, 21.5, 25.8 and 15 % produced enterohaemolysin, a-haemolysin, and aerobactin respectively, 1.6 % displayed localized adherence (LA) to HEp-2 cells, 27.6 % were sorbitol negative, and 30 % were resistant to antibiotics. Only 14 (3.1 %) of the STEC isolates belonged to human infection-associated serogroups (O26, O55, O111, O128 and O157), designated as enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). This study revealed that STEC are prevalent in domestic animals, and to a lesser extent in food of animal origin in Serbia, but the absence of a EHEC phenotypic profile (characteristic serogroup, LA, enterohaemolysin production) in most animal STEC strains may explain the low incidence of human STEC infection in this part of the world.

We find that the nutrient releases from a fish farm producing 100 tons of salmon correspond to those of a human settlement of 850-3200 persons. Extrapolating the results to the 200 000 tons of salmonid production by Nordic countries, the release exceeds those of the population of Stockholm, the largest city in Sweden, and even whole states, such as Lithuania. Internalizing the environmental cost of the nutrient release from salmon farms at the level of the firm reveals that the total cost of salmon production exceeds the highest price paid for salmon in the 1980s, the decade when the industry boomed. In addition, there are several other environmental impacts not internalized. It is concluded that, from the viewpoint of Swedish society, salmonid farming, as performed today in coastal waters, is not only ecologically but also economically unsustainable.

Other uses of such information include agricultural studies, meteorological forecasting, environment, and energy conversion. In this study, the ratio of monthly average hourly diffuse radiation to monthly average hourly global radiation (Id/I) was correlated with the monthly average hourly clearness index (kT) in the form of the polynomial relationships for the city of Izmir in the western part of Turkey. Experimental data were measured in the Solar-Meteorological Station of Solar Energy Institute in Ege University over a 5 year period from 1994 to 1998. The values of the monthly average-daily hours of bright sunshine (S) varied between 3.54 and 12.28. The values of the monthly average-daily clearness index (KT) ranged from 0.41 to 0.66, averaged for the same period. The frequency distribution of the clearness index was also given. It can be concluded that the present models estimate the values of Id for Izmir, and possibly elsewhere with similar climatic conditions, reasonably well if the values of I are known or can be predicted.

J		Article		Results of bacteriological examinations of cow milk in three municipalities in the epizootiological region of the town of Uzice in 1995		Matovic, K.; Zarkovic, A.; Tomic, A.; Sekler, M.; Debeljak, Z.; Rajkovic, M.; Knezevic, S.; Nenadic, D.; Popovic, P.									Veterinarski Glasnik		1996		50	5-6	415-418	415	418	Serbo Croatian						In addition to sterility, cow udder diseases present the biggest health and economic problem. The incidence of infectious mastitis was examined in this work (mastitis infectiosa bovum, staphylococcal and streptococcal) in the individual sector of three municipalities in the epizoological region of the town of Uzice. We examined 419 milk samples which reacted positive to the California Mastitis Test (CMT). The milk samples were examined by conventional bacteriological methods in the bacteriological laboratory VSI "Kraljevo". On the basis of the obtained results, we concluded that the number of subclinical mastitis cases was increased, especially those caused by Staphylococcus aureus. From the total of 419 milk samples positive to CMT, Staphylococcus aureus was established in 136 (32.46%), which presents a considerable increase compared with the results of earlier examinations, when the percentage of infection caused by this carrier was from 1.59-23.70 in the individual sector. We concluded that the regular use of CMT in health control of the udder is necessary, and also bacteriological examination of all samples positive to CMT.	Vet. Spec. Inst.

J		Article		The response of soil organic matter to manure amendments in a long-term experiment at Ultuna, Sweden		Gerzabek, M. H.; Pichlmayer, F.; Kirchmann, H.; Haberhauer, G.									European Journal of Soil Science		1997		48	2	273-282	273	282	English						In a long-term field experiment started in 1956 on a clay loam soil at Uppsala, Sweden, changes of organic carbon in the topsoils receiving various organic amendments at the rate of 2000 kg C ha-1 year-1 were studied to determine soil organic matter characteristics, variations of delta-13 C in the soil and to estimate a carbon balance. Fallow and mineral fertilizer without N led to a significant decrease of soil organic matter (SOM) in the soil, green manure maintained the SOM content, and animal manure and peat increased the SOM content significantly. The stable portion of the added organic materials after 37 years of continuous input was 12.8, 27.3, and 56.7%, for green manure, animal manure and peat, respectively. This was reflected by half-lives of organic carbon originating from the amendments between 3.0 (green manure) and 14.6 years (peat). The isotopic composition of SOM changed both due to mineralization (continuous fallow) and the addition of amendments isotopically different from soil humus (green manure, animal manure). The isotopic effect was used to calculate the percentage of carbon derived from animal manure present for the year 1993. This value (55.4%) was larger than that derived from the carbon balance, which indicated a priming effect of the animal manure on the initial soil humus. Mineralization of microbially available organic substances led to an increase in the degree of humification on plots not receiving organic amendments. Adding peat and animal manure resulted in a decrease of the humification index due to the continuous input of poorly humified material. The extinction ratio (E-4/E-6) and ratio of fulvic acid to humic acid changed considerably in the peat treated plots. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)-measurements of the extracts showed that peat characteristics can be detected in peat treated soils. The other amendments did not alter the characteristics of the extractable humic substances.	Gerzabek, M. H.; Austrian Res.

J		Article		Consumer confidence and UK food retailing: Why does local food matter?		Lyon, Phil (h.p.lyon@dundee.ac.uk) ; Colquhoun, Anne; Janhonen-Abruquah, Hille									Journal of Food Agriculture & Environment		2003	JAN 2003	1	1	12-21	12	21	English						Over the last 50 years, the UK fresh food market has been increasingly challenged by the growth and domination of large grocery chains. Supermarkets now source supplies on a national and international basis. They have purchasing power to undercut small-scale local production and distribution systems that minimise many of the past advantages of short distances between the producer and the consumer. This alters producer perspectives. Larger-scale production and sales contracts for national distribution are favoured. Smaller producers focusing on supply to local markets have tended to struggle as retail opportunities for their fresh produce diminished. Street markets for fresh food, once the main source for the UK urban population, are now a minor contributor to overall sales. In part this results from a larger population and the limited number of markets operating within traditional constraints of time and location. In part, also, consumer perceptions of quality in street markets declined with the ascent of pre-washed bimbo fruit and vegetables along with the disembodied, pre-packed meat favoured by many. Excessive pesticide use, BSE, foot & mouth disease and E.coli problems have all recently taken their toll of consumer confidence and have disturbed taken-for-granted urban assumptions about food safety. Furthermore, media attention on factory farming techniques have focussed public disquiet on issues that, until a few years ago, many consumers were happy to ignore. Vegetarianism, organic production methods and attempts to reconnect food producers and local consumers are arguably related strategies emerging from these problematic issues of consumer confidence. By reference to UK experiences over the last 10 years, the paper explores food shopping trend convergence, reduced consumer trust, and attempts to restore confidence.

J	17998423	Article		Pros and cons of automatic milking in Europe		Svennersten-Sjaunja, K. M. (Kerstin.svennersten@huv.slu.se) ; Pettersson, G.									Journal of Animal Science		2008	MAR 2008	86	13, Suppl. 1	37-46	37	46	English						During the last several decades, new milking management systems have been introduced, of which development of automatic milking (AM) systems is a significant step forward. In Europe, AM has become an established management system and has shown to be much more than milking management. Factors such as milking, milk quality, feeding, cow traffic, grazing, and animal behavior are essential elements of AM. This system offers possibilities for more frequent milking and can be adapted to lactational stage. Increased milk yield with AM has been observed, but lack of increased production has also been reported from the field, probably due to less attention paid to the total management system. The AM system provides consistent milking routines, with those for teat stimulation and feeding during milking giving an adequate oxytocin release and milk ejection. Initially, reduced milk quality, such as increased FFA, total bacteria count, and somatic cell count (SCC), was observed. Increased FFA could be due to increased milking frequency or handling of the milk, although this has not yet been determined. The elevated total bacteria count was probably due to mismanagement because later studies indicated that teat cleaning in AM is sufficient to reduce spores and dirt on the teats. Significant positive effects on udder health and teat treatment were observed in some studies, possibly as an effect of quarter milking, a procedure whereby an individual teat cup is detached when milk flow is below the preset level for detachment. Well-functioning cow traffic is a prerequisite for successful AM system performance to obtain an optimal number of visits to the feeding area and the milking parlor for all cows. Technical stoppages in the AM system (i.e., the milking unit) increased milk SCC, and the variation and length of the milking interval seem to contribute to elevated SCC. Grazing is a common management routine in many countries. Different ways to motivate the cows to visit the milking parlor, such as shorter distance between barn and pasture, supplement feeding, access to water, and use of acoustic signals, have been tested. It was concluded that use of AM and grazing systems together is possible as long as the distance from the milking parlor to pasture is short. With proper management routines, it is possible to achieve a production level and animal well-being in AM systems that are at least as good as in conventional milking systems.	Svennersten-Sjaunja, K.

J		Article		Abortion in ewes associated with Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae		Fthenakis, G. C. (gcf@vet.uth.gr) ; Christodoulopoulos, G.; Leontides, L.; Tzora, A.									Small Ruminant Research		2006	MAY 2006	63	1-2	183-188	183	188	English						We describe the features of an outbreak of ovine abortions caused by Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae in a flock of sheep in Greece. Abortion occurred in 3.5% of ewes in the flock; the foetuses were well developed and had congested lungs and sero-haemorrhagic fluid in the thoracic cavity; pinpoint, necrotic-like lesions were recorded on the placental cotyledons, whilst the inter-cotyledonary areas appeared normal. The same findings were also recorded in the foetus and the foetal membranes of a pregnant ewe that died and was necropsied; on the foetal membranes of that animal, bright yellow-coloured amniotic plaques were also seen. Lameness was recorded in 3% of the ewes in the flock; oedema of the periarticular tissues and sparse synovial fluid in the infected joints were evident in a ewe that died and was necropsied. Long-standing lameness was recorded in two fattening pigs, reared in the farm. E. rhusiopathiae was isolated in pure culture and heavy growth from joints of the pigs, joints, lungs, liver, foetuses and placentae of the ewe that died, aborted foetuses and placentae from the ewes that aborted, synovial fluid from the lame ewes. The identity of the organism was confirmed by means of conventional bacteriological techniques and the API-system. Specific tests for other common causes of ovine abortion were carried out, but no evidence of involvement of other agents was found. On the basis of all the evidence available, a diagnosis of erysipelas was made. Penicillin was given to all ewes in the flock and sanitation measures were applied to control the disease.

J		Article		[The Iris meadows (Iridetum sibiricae Philippi 1960) in the middle of the Styrian Enns valley (Styria, Austria): Ecology, sociology and nature protection.]	Die Iris-Wiesen (Iridetum sibiricae Philippi 1960) im Mittleren Steirischen Ennstal (Steiermark, Oesterreich): Oekologie, Soziologie und Naturschutz	Bohner, Andreas; Sobotik, Monika; Zechner, Lisbeth									Tuexenia		2001			21	133-151	133	151	German	print					The Iris meadows are typical litter meadows of the Enns valley. The plant community prefers hydromorphic soils of low nutrient supply in the carbonate or silicate buffer-range. The upper part of the soil is characterized by high humus content and a relatively wide C/N ratio. The soils are often supersaturated with Ca or Mg and mainly have a low content of lactate- and water-soluble P. The subassoziation with Crepis paludosa arises mainly on moderately wet Eutric Histosols and Gleyic Fluvisols. The typical subassoziation mainly grows on humid Gleyic Fluvisols. The subassoziation with Galium verum prefers moderately humid Umbric Fluvisols. The Iridetum sibiricae is replaced by a Cirsium oleraceum-Persicaria bistorta community through yearly manuring and utilisation twice a year. On temporally flooded, wet stands the Iridetum sibiricae is replaced by the Caricetum gracilis, on deep acidic Eutric Histosols by the Junco-Molinietum caeruleae. An early cutinisation of the rhizodermis, a special lignification of the exodermis and the tanning idioblasts of the cortex cells give special protection against rotting. By dissolution of the cortex cells, the gas exchange on the hydromorphic soils can be improved. The roots of Iris sibirica are infected by VA-mycorrhiza, therefore the P uptake on P-poor soils may be improved. The above-ground phytomass of Iris meadows can be used as bedding material, but has no feeding value for cows. The fodder is characterized by a relatively high content of crude fibre and a low content of crude protein; the digestibility of the organic matter and the net energy content is very low. The above-ground phytomass has a low content of N, P, K and Na, and a partly high content of Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Co, Cr, Ni, Cd, Pb and As. The hydromorphic soil and the vegetation, rich in herbs, are mainly responsible for the relatively high content of heavy metals and As in the above-ground phytomass of Iris meadows. The relatively species-rich Iris meadow is a biotope for many seldom and protected plant and animal species. The care and protection of the Iris meadows is an important function of agriculture, therefore traditional utilisation of the litter meadows is necessary.

J		Article		[Efficiency of spectomycin and linkomycin in controlling swine colibacteriosis.]	Stosowanie spektynomycyny i linkomycyny w profilaktyce kolibakteriozy prosiat	Zmudzki, Jacek; Kamyczek, Marian; Kwaczynski, Ryszard									Medycyna Weterynaryjna		2002		58	4	285-287	285	287	Polish	print					The purpose of the trial was to evaluate the effect of Linco-SpectinTM 44 Premix in controlling and preventing post-weaning diarrhoea in piglets. Linco-SpectinTM 44 Premix (22 g of active linkomycin and 22 g of active spectynomycin) is one of the most readily accepted broad-spectrum antibiotics used in pig production. Tests investigating the preventive efficiency of Linco-SpectinTM 44 Premix were carried out on a farrow-to-finish farm located in western Poland with an annual production of 15 000 fatteners. The test was carried out on 13 618 animals. 6558 piglets from 16 technological groups were used as experimental and 7060 piglets from the same number of technological groups served as controls. Linco-SpectinTM 44 Premix was administered to the experimental pigs for 14 days post-weaning at a dose of 2kg/tone. Trimerazin (Sulfamerazin; Trimetoprim) was given to all the control groups. The parameters of production in every experimental group were compared with the results in all control groups in order to estimate the efficiency of antibiotic therapy. The following criteria were considered: average body weight from weaning to day 70 of life, number of piglets which died and mean body weight gains over this period. Symptoms of diarrhoea and poor growth were observed 4 days after weaning, while at day 5, 6 and 7 sudden death occurred in all the groups of weaned pigs. Pathological investigations of the dead animals revealed changes including mild hyperaemia with dilatation of flaccid small intestines and mesenteric and gastric oedema. Results showed that at day 70 of life the body weight of the experimental pigs was 21.02 kg i.e. about 2 kg higher then in the control pigs whose average weight was 19.10 kg. The mortality rate of the experimental groups (2.10%) in the investigated farm was nearly half that of the control groups (4.39%). Bacteriological findings revealed the growth of E. coli. Using conventional anti-microbial disc diffusion susceptibility tests on an unsupplemented Mueller-Hinton medium, all the examined strains of E. coli demonstrated susceptibility to spectomycin and linkomycin. The multiplex PCR technique was used to detect genotype markers of F18 fimbriae responsible for colonising intestine mucosa. The results indicated that the use of linkomycin-spectynomicin in piglet's feed 2 weeks after weaning had a beneficial effect on their average body weight, decreased the number of deaths and prevented the animals from contracting diarrhoea caused by enteropathogenic E. coli.

J	17118427	Article		Volatile organic compounds in dwelling houses and stables of dairy and cattle farms in Northern Germany		Beck, Jens P. (jbeck@gwdg.de) ; Heutelbeck, Astrid; Dunkelberg, Hartinut									Science of the Total Environment		2007	JAN 1 2007	372	2-3	440-454	440	454	English						Farmers are exposed to a complex mixture of airborne substances which can represent a health hazard. Especially animal production on a farm can be a risk factor for respiratory diseases. Most studies in this context focused on bioaerosols, compounds attached to bioaerosols or on gases such as ammonia or hydrogen sulfide. Less attention was paid to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which may also cause respiratory diseases. This pilot study presents results of measuring VOCs in the air of the dwellings and stables, as well as in the outdoor environment, of cattle farms in Northern Germany in spring and autumn. Fanners on all selected farms complained of symptoms such as asthma, rhinitis and conjunctivitis which occurred especially during work in the stable but also in the dwellings. The mean concentration of total VOC (TVOC) for the outdoor environment, the dwellings, and the stables were 100 mu g m(-3), 763 mu g m(-3), 322 mu g m(-3) in spring and 143 mu g m(-3), 544 mu g m(-3), 595 mu g m(-3) in autumn, respectively. There was no significant difference in season. TVOC concentrations in dwellings on farms were elevated when compared to dwellings in other environments, probably because of an additional exposure to fuels and chemicals used in agriculture. Aliphatic and alicyclic hydrocarbons, aromatic compounds, and terpenes were main compounds of the dwellings and ketones, alcohols, and esters of the stables. Terpene concentrations in the stables were low probably because straw, which was not a strong terpene emitter, was used instead of sawdust as floor covering. Large amounts of methylethylketone were encountered in the air of one stable, probably from animal exhalation caused by increased animal activity. However, it was unlikely that this caused respiratory symptoms. Generally it was likely that the concentrations of VOCs were too low to have health effects on their own. On the other hand, the VOC concentrations were in a multifactor concentration range in which health effects could occur depending on the interaction with other exposure factors. Fungal spores and bacteria were observed in addition to VOCs at the examined locations. Therefore it is possible that the observed VOCs played a role in exacerbating respiratory symptoms in this multifactor exposure. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J		Article		Short communication. Effects of endophyte infection on dry matter yield, persistence and nutritive value of perennial ryegrass in Galicia (north-west Spain)		Oliveira, J. A. (oliveira@uniovi.es) ; Gonzalez, E.; Castro, P.; Costal, L.									Spanish Journal of Agricultural Research		2004	December 2004	2	4	558-563	558	563	English	print					Dry matter yield, persistence and three parameters of nutritive value were determined in two perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) genotypes either infected with a lolitrem B-free fungal endophyte or not infected, over a four-year period at two different locations in north-west Spain. The endophyte did not influence the productivity or persistence of perennial ryegrass in the four years of study. Insufficiently stressful conditions could explain these results. The nutritive value of the plants was not influenced by endophyte infection, except for organic matter digestibility and water-soluble carbohydrates on some occasions (P < 0.05). The organic matter digestibility mean value (2 significant comparisons out of 8) was slightly higher in infected ryegrass (72.4 and 83.4%) than in ryegrass free of endophyte (70.3 and 82.6%). The water-soluble carbohydrates mean content (2 significant comparisons out of 8) was higher for endophyte-infected (18.5 and 26.3%;) than for endophyte-free ryegrass (17.3 and 24.6%). These differences were small and are insufficient to recommend endophyte-infected perennial ryegrass for forage production in the study areas.	Oliveira, J.

A case-control study was conducted on 53 male cases and 106 controls matched for sex, age (.+-. 2.5 yr), residence and hospital from which cases were drawn. Individual interviews were carried out for the evaluation of ethnic, environmental, pathologic and occupational risk factors. Lip cancer was significantly associated with: fair, brown, or red hair (relative odds [r.o.] = 2.3), blue eyes (r.o. = 5.3), fair skin (r.o. = 8.0], sensitivity to sunburns (r.o. = 4.1), working outdoors (r.o. = 4.9), coexistence of non-specific lesions of exposed body parts (r.o. = 12.2), low socioeconomic status (r.o. = 15.8), farming (r.o. = 2.6) and working in greenhouses (r.o. = 12.0). Recall of recurrent herpes-labialis was not significantly associated; also association with tobacco smoking was not significant after adjustment for socioeconomic status. Risk increased exponentially with the number of ethnic characteristics of northern European populations.

Smerdon, William J.; Nichols, Tom; Chalmers, Rachel M.; Heine, Hilary; Reacher, Mark H. (mreacher@phls.org.uk)									Emerging Infectious Diseases		2003	January 2003	9	1	22-28	22	28	English	print					During the 2001 epidemic of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in livestock in England and Wales, we discovered a corresponding decrease in laboratory reports of cryptosporidiosis in humans. Using a regression model of laboratory reports of cryptosporidiosis, we found an estimated 35% (95% confidence interval (CI) 20% to 47%) reduction in reports during the weeks spanning the period from the first and last cases of FMD. The largest reduction occurred in northwest England, where the estimated decrease was 63% (95% CI 31% to 80%). Genotyping a subgroup of human isolates suggested that the proportion of Cryptosporidium genotype 2 strain (animal and human) was lower during the weeks of the FMD epidemic in 2001 compared with the same weeks in 2000. Our observations are consistent with livestock making a substantial contribution to Cryptosporidium infection in humans in England and Wales; our findings have implications for agriculture, visitors to rural areas, water companies, and regulators.

J		Article		Effects of Natural Barriers and Habitat on the Western Spread of Raccoon Rabies in Alabama		Arjo, Wendy M. (wendy.m.arjo@aphis.usda.gov) ; Fisher, Christine E.; Armstrong, James; Boyd, Frank; Slate, Dennis									Journal of Wildlife Management		2008	NOV 2008	72	8	1725-1735	1725	1735	English						Although domestic animal transmission of rabies has largely been mitigated, the disease remains a concern in both Europe and North America where wildlife transmission has caused epizootics. Raccoon (Procyon lotor) rabies was established in Alabama, USA, in 1975, primarily in the southeastern corner of the state. However, with the exception of isolated events, rabies has not continued to spread westward across the Alabama River. We monitored movements of 100 radiocollared raccoons on 2 sites within hardwood and agriculture habitats in a rabies enzootic area east of the Alabama River, in managed pine habitat area west of the river where rabies sporadically occurs, and in a mixed pine hardwood area outside of the known rabies enzootic area to determine if raccoon movements and habitat use in certain habitat types and the presence of a river may serve as natural barriers preventing the western spread of rabies in Alabama. We also examined raccoon contact rates to determine if they influence disease transmission through static and dynamic interactions. Raccoons in mixed pine-hardwood forest habitats had smaller home ranges and less overlap of ranges compared to the other 3 habitats. However, static interactions between habitats in the use of overlap areas did not differ (F-11,F-129 = 1.63, P = 0.09). Rabies antibody titers were highest in the managed pine habitat (28%) even prior to oral vaccine bait distributions in spring of 2004 and 2005. Biomarker data from radiocollared and additional raccoons captured after the bait distribution west of the Alabama River demonstrated a low efficacy of the vaccine reaching the small southern raccoons. The combination of the river as a partial barrier, the high percentage of pine forested habitat west of the river, and limited spatial movements of raccoons within these forested habitats appears to have reduced the likelihood of rabies establishing west of the river. Understanding different host-habitat disease systems is important for successful management of diseases. Based on our results, we recommend that the oral vaccine program continue to use the Alabama River as a partial barrier and baiting be concentrated in the fragmented bottomland hardwood forests and around larger bodies of water where raccoon densities are highest. Success of baiting strategies designed to take advantage of northern raccoon dynamics and habitat use may not be applicable to southern populations.

This was a matched case-control study with analysis based on the first 43 cases of tularemia (probable or suspected) and 43 matched controls. A probable case was defined as a patient, resident in Suluova, who had signs and symptoms (regional Lymphadenopathy and fever) compatible with tularemia and a positive serology or PCR for Francisella tularensis during the period October 21 to November 31, 2004. A suspected case was defined as a patient with compatible signs and symptoms who did not meet the laboratory criteria for a probable case, who also had no laboratory evidence of infection by other microorganisms, and who was resident in Suluova between the same dates. The microagglutination test was used for serological diagnosis. A standardized questionnaire was used to collect information on general demographics, exposure to all known sources of tularemia infection, potential risk factors related to water and animals (i.e., fishing, farming, hunting, and other activities), and the environmental conditions of the house. PCR was used to screen for evidence of the tularemia agents in clinical samples from patients and water samples.Results: The overall attack rate was 2.3 per 1000 population (86/38 000). Twenty-eight suspected cases and 15 probable cases of tularemia were included in the study. The most common presenting symptom was lymphadenopathy present in 95.3%, followed by fever (83.7%) and sore throat (79.1%). Twenty-eight out of 43 were reported to have painful lymph nodes. F tularensis was detected by PCR in samples obtained from the ulcerated lesions of two patients. In the multivariate logistic regression model, keeping a domestic animal in the garden was associated with an increased risk of contracting the disease (OR = 10.87; 95% CI: 1.26-93.65; p = 0.03). F tularensis was detected by PCR in the water sample obtained from the rivulet that passes through Suluova.Conclusions: The results of this study show that case-control studies may be useful for analyzing epidemics and for identifying the source of infection. In order to prevent water-related zoonotic infections, water and sewerage systems should be improved. (C) 2007 International Society for Infectious Diseases. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Livestock Science		2006	JUL 2006	102	3	211-215	211	215	English						The aim of this experiment was to study the effect of the application of pig slurry on potential pathogen (total and faecal coliform bacteria) presence in a Typic Xerofluvent soil. The experiment was conducted in field conditions, in the Segura River valley in the South East of Spain. Four treatments, in a fully-randomised design with three replicates per treatment, were established in experimental plots of 16 m 2 each. Fertiliser treatments were: MF, mineral fertiliser (with a complex 16N-16P(2)O(5)-16K(2)O) equivalent to 150 kg N ha(-1); PSF, organic fertilisation with swine manure slurry, at two different rates (supplying 150 and 2 10 kg N ha(-1)), and C, a controlled treatment without fertilisation. A high variability of the concentrations of total and faecal coliforms was observed during the experiment, mainly depends on the time and the treatment. The pig slurry amendment induced the highest initial and also persistent presence of total and faccal coliform bacteria. The higher application rate seemed to induce a long-lasting persistence of the total, but especially the faecal coliform, population in the amended soils compared to the lower rate. In most cases, an increase in the total coliforms content was observed in the soils amended with mineral fertiliser compared to controlled soils, probably due to an increase in soil microorganisms populations. In general, the total coliform bacteria was 2-3 log 10 units higher than the faecal ones. Mostly, a tendency to decrease with time was observed in both indicator microorganisms, in all the treatments. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J		Article		Heathlands and the heather beetle (Lochmaea suturalis)		Taksdal, Gudmund									Fauna (Oslo)		1997		50	1	20-28	20	28	Norwegian						An overview is given on the development of the Calluna vulgaris heathlands, and especially on the role of the heather beetle in relation to other major factors causing decline of the heathlands. As a pioneer stage in ecological succession, the heathlands depended on agricultural exploitation for their existence. When agriculture or conservation are absent, the heather may reach an age where beetle attacks combined with other factors like drought, low winter temperatures and increased deposition of atmospheric N may kill C. vulgaris. The N deposition in Norway has not yet reached a level where this factor alone will endanger the future of heathlands. The heather beetle is found mainly in coastal areas in Norway up to about 62 degree N. Its life cycle and relationships to heathlands agree well with investigations in Denmark and other countries. Severe outbreaks of heather beetle occurred during the eighties and early nineties. It is estimated that beetle destruction of heathland in 1991 caused a loss of 2.5 million NKR to 300 small-scale beekeepers in the county of Rogaland. High populations of adults, and beginning migration, were observed at severely damaged heather 20 May 1992. Some natural enemies of the heather beetle were found: The ladybird Coccinella hieroglyphica and nabid bugs (Nabis spp.). The entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana was found in dead pupae.

In this study, the effects of the amount of N fertilizer (0, 50, 100 and 150 kg N ha-1), the date of N application (July and August) and the date of winter harvest (December, January and February) on the quality and dry matter (DM) yield of Festuca arundinacea stands in winter were investigated. DM yield, the metabolizable energy and digestibility of organic matter (=in vitro rumen fermentation technique), crude protein, ADL (acid detergent lignin), and for the first time ergosterol were determined. Disregarding the 0 variant, no interactions of any relevance were present. DM yield, crude protein and values of ADL increased with increasing amounts of N, but the concentration of energy decreased. The late N application resulted mostly in lower DM yields but kept the forage physiologically younger, which brought about higher levels of metabolizable energy and lower concentrations of ADL. With later date of harvest, losses of mass and quality occurred. The degree of fungal infection rose as the amount of N fertilizer increased. Three years of investigation under different weather conditions, including interactions with the effects of N fertilization, provide a good base for generalization.

J	14522706	Article		Prevalence and transmission of haemolytic Gallibacterium species in chicken production systems with different biosecurity levels.		Bojesen, Anders Miki (miki@kvl.dk) ; Nielsen, Soren Saxmose; Bisgaard, Magne									Avian Pathology		2003	October 2003	32	5	503-510	503	510	English	print					A stratified cross-sectional study consisting of four strata of biosecurity based on production system type, including organic/free-range layer, battery-cage layer, layer parent, broiler parent and broiler grandparent flocks, was performed to estimate the prevalence of haemolytic Gallibacterium spp. Thirty birds were sampled by tracheal and cloacal swabs in each flock. A flock was considered infected when just one bird tested positive. A total of 27 flocks was included in the study. All chickens from the broiler grandparent flocks sampled negative, whereas 28% of the broiler parents, 40% of the layer parents, 67% of the battery-cage layers and 96% of the organic/free-range chickens sampled positive. A total of 95.9% (standard deviation +-7.6%) of birds from infected flocks was colonized by haemolytic Gallibacterium species. A significantly higher number of tracheal swabs was positive compared with cloacal swabs. The probability of vertical transfer was investigated by sampling offspring from an infected as well as a non-infected parent flock. None of the samples were found positive. In conclusion, we showed that haemolytic Gallibacterium spp. were widely distributed within the Danish commercial chicken production systems. However, prevalence proportions were highly influenced by the production system and found to be significantly associated with the biosecurity level observed in the flocks. In general, flock infections resembled an 'all or none' type of colonization as practically all of the chickens in infected flocks sampled positive. There was no evidence of vertical transmission of Gallibacterium.

J		Article		Marine crustacean farming: Present status and perspectives		Laubier, Annie; Laubier, Lucien									Aquatic Living Resources		1993		6	4	319-329	319	329	English						For centuries, several species of prawns and crabs have been raised from wild-caught juveniles in coastal brackish-water fish ponds in various countries of southeast Asia. The Indonesian "tambaks" are well known examples of such traditional practices. In western countries, since the turn of the century, advances of marine biology and fast increase of marine fisheries enabled the development of large-scale production and release of larval stages of American and European lobsters in a fruitless attempt to restock natural populations. After the Second World War, the increasing demand for crustaceans in United States and Japan was satisfied by opening new prawn fisheries all over the world. A major breakthrough was achieved with the development of hatchery technologies for the penaeid prawn Penaeus japonicus (Hudinaga, 1942 in Japan) and the caridean prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii (Ling, 1969 in Malaysia), which occurred during the first decades of the second half of this century. Together with the increasing market demand in developed countries for sea food, this led to a considerable interest of both public agencies and private investors in marine shrimp and prawn culture. In western countries, a large number of pioneering commercial ventures, often based on assumptions not scientifically founded, failed. Nevertheless, the aquaculture production of prawns mainly based on wild-caught juveniles increased in South-East Asia and Central America during the 1980s. This overall positive trend should not hide important failures which occurred at a local scale, such as the Taiwanese crisis of 1988 due principally to environmental degradation, resulting in severe disease problems and a near collapse of the farming activity. Following the early period of hatchery technology development, the major scientific achievements were related to food requirements and formulation of compound diets for larvae, juveniles and adults and to a better knowledge of diseases caused by bacteria and several viruses which have been identified from hatcheries and intensive farming ponds. Additional new technological advances have emerged from recent research in the fields of physiology (endocrinology) and genetics. By far, the major part of the world production of marine crustaceans relies on penaeid prawns and, to a lesser extent, on Macrobrachium species. However, some other species of marine crustaceans have potential for aquaculture. The economic aspects of marine crustacean aquaculture should be considered together with those of the fishing industry: market prices are rather similar, depending on the quality of the product. The balance between market demand and production is an important constraint which, in turn, establishes the success of prawn farming. Since the early 1980s, crustacean aquaculture has increased tremendously in both Asia and America: the world production for 1991 approximated 700,000 tons, with more than 600,000 tons from penaeid prawn culture.

Our aim was to establish whether the shading due to the breeding structures (tables) was the cause of a lowering in microphytobenthic oxygen production. Measurements of net oxygen production in benthic chambers indicated that in sediments under the tables, a supplement of light could be responsible for a strong increase in microphytobenthic primary production. This occurred only in March, when temperature was the lowest, suggesting a coupling between temperature and light in the regulation of microphytobentic production. In July, as well as in September, incident light was not the factor limiting microphytobenthic production; respiration rates were maximum and heterotrophic mechanisms prevailed. However, in neighboring sediments beside the tables, the microphytobenthic population always received their optimum of incident light.	Barranguet, Christiane; Netherlands Inst.

Most of the infections resulted from the H7N7 high pathogenicity Al (HPAI) virus from The Netherlands (2003) and H5N1 HPAI viruses from several Asian countries (1997-2005). Epidemiological studies have identified direct exposure to infected poultry as the primary risk factor for human infection. In The Netherlands, veterinarians, cullers and poultry farmers had an occupational risk of infection through exposure to infected commercial poultry; and presented with conjunctivitis and/or influenza-like illnesses. In Asia, most of the clinical infections involved direct exposure to poultry in the smallholder sector or live poultry markets, and not commercial poultry. However, serological data from Hong Kong during 1997 indicated H5N1 infections without clinical disease were associated with occupational exposure. No cases of human Al infection have been linked to consumption of infected or contaminated poultry products. However, HPAI virus can be present in blood, bone and meat of infected poultry, which, if consumed raw, are a potential source of virus for human infections. Cooking and pasteurisation are effective methods of killing Al viruses. Proper vaccination of poultry has been shown to prevent HPAI virus from localising in the meat.	Swayne, D.

Many of the fish had skin ulcers. Internally prominent dark-brown petechiae or ecchymotic haemorrhage was observed. Splenomegaly was associated with congestion and widespread necrosis. A Vibrio sp. was isolated from internal organs. Biochemically isolates of the bacterium were similar to a previously described bacterium, Vibrio viscosus, recorded in a phenotypic study from farmed salmon in Norway. This work examines the occurrence of V. viscosus in marine-reared Atlantic salmon for the first time in Scottish waters. An experimental study reproduced the field observations and Koch's postulates were fulfilled. The histopathology associated with natural infection was compared with that in laboratory-infected fish.

J		Article		The spatial distribution of badgers, setts and latrines: the risk for intra-specific and badger-livestock disease transmission		Bohm, Monika (PCLW1@york.ac.uk) ; Palphramand, Kate L.; Newton-Cross, Geraldine; Hutchings, Michael R.; White, Piran C. L.									Ecography		2008	AUG 2008	31	4	525-537	525	537	English						The spatial distribution of wildlife hosts and the associated environmental distribution of their excretory products are important factors associated with the risk of disease transmission between wildlife and livestock. At a landscape scale, heterogeneous distribution of a wildlife host will create regional hot spots for disease risk, while at the farm level, distributional patterns of wildlife excretory products as well as habitat use are of primary importance to the assessment of disease risk to livestock. In the UK, badgers have been implicated in the transmission of bovine tuberculosis to cattle. In this study, we focus on the spatial and social organization and habitat use of badgers as well as the distributions of their excretions at latrine and sett sites to assess intra- and inter-species (badger-cattle) disease risk. Across the study site, badger latrines and setts were found in prominent clusters, at distances of up to 250 and 200 m respectively. This was partly due to small-scale clustering of latrines around sett sites, so that disease risk may be higher within the vicinity of setts. The clustered distribution suggests that sites of high risk for TB transmission may be localised within farms. Exclusion of cattle from the few sett and latrine sites within their grazing pasture is therefore likely to provide an effective way of reducing the risk of disease transmission. We also found evidence of social sub-division within badger social groups based on differences in the use of main and outlier setts. This may contribute to localised clusters of infection within the badger population, resulting in heterogeneous patterns of environmental disease risk to the wider host community. A greater understanding of variation in host behaviour and its implications for patterns of disease will allow the development of more targeted and effective management strategies for wildlife disease in group-living hosts.

Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems		2004	September 2004	70	1	13-22	13	22	English	print					About 40% of the agricultural land in the European Union (EU) is grassland used for animal production. When grassland is tilled, organically bound carbon and nitrogen are released, providing substrates for nitrifying and denitrifying microorganisms. The aim of this study was to examine the immediate effects of tillage of a perennial grassland carried out on different dates, on the emissions of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O), monitored intensively over a 5-day period, in a humid, dairy farming area of northern Spain. Soil was tilled 12 days and 2 days prior to fertiliser application. Tillage, time of tillage, and N fertiliser application affected NO and N2O emissions. Tillage 12 days before the start of the flux measurements resulted in higher emissions than tillage one day before, the difference being related to differences in soil mineral N and water-filled pore space (WFPS). Emissions of NO peaked at a WFPS of 50-60%, while N2O fluxes peaked at 70-90% WFPS. Loss of N was greater as N2O than as NO. The total loss of N as N2O plus NO ranged from 0.027 kg N ha-1 in unfertilised plots to 0.56 kg N ha-1 in the tilled and N fertilised plot. Thereafter emissions decreased rapidly to low values. The results of this study indicate that tillage of perennial grassland may release large amounts of NO and N2O, the amounts also depending on moisture conditions and addition of N fertiliser. We suggest that in order to reduce such emissions, application of N fertiliser should not immediately follow tillage of perennial grassland, as there is an extra supply of N from mineralisation of organic matter at this time.

Journal of Dairy Science		2007	DEC 2007	90	12	5798-5813	5798	5813	English						The objective of this study was to report the prevalence of intramammary infections ( IMI) in Ragusa, Sicily, from milk samples ( n = 18,711) collected between October 2000 and June 2006 from 101 dairy herds. Milk samples were collected at 9,747 cow sampling events from 5,285 individual cows. Samples were individual quarter ( 92.8%) or composite samples ( 7.2%) from an individual cow. Logistic regression was used to examine the prevalence of IMI at the level of milk sample and at the level of cow, controlling for year and season of collection, type of sample ( individual quarter or composite), and type of housing and bedding of the cow at the time of collection. Bedding and housing types were as follows, respectively ( number of herd groups): bedding: none ( 61), organic [ 51 ( straw, 50; sawdust, 1)], and sand ( 3); housing: bedded pack ( 37), free stalls ( 57), tie stalls ( 4), and paddock ( 17). Raw prevalence of cow IMI for a sample event was as follows ( percentage of cow samples): no growth, 47.4%; coagulase-negative staphylococci, 22.6%; Staphylococcus aureus, 20.6%; other Streptococcus spp., 11.1%; Streptococcus agalactiae, 2.3%; coliform bacteria, 2.9%; and other organisms, 5.8%. Prevalence of IMI differed by bedding type for Staph. aureus ( none, 24.5%; organic, 12.7%; sand, 12.3%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci ( none, 13.1%; organic, 27.4%; sand, 26.9%) but not for Streptococcus spp. or coliform bacteria. Prevalence of Streptococcus spp. IMI differed by housing type ( tie stalls, 22.2%; bedded pack, 12.8%; free stalls, 8.4%; paddock, 7.1%). Housing was not associated with the prevalence of IMI for other bacteria. Herd monthly prevalence of Staph. aureus and Streptococcus spp. IMI was associated with decreased mean milk production ( Staph. aureus, -1.42 kg/d per cow, SEM 0.51; Streptococcus spp., -1.31 kg/d per cow, SEM 0.64) and increased mean linear score ( Staph. aureus, 1.01 units/d per cow, SEM 0.16; Streptococcus spp., 0.59 units/d per cow, SEM 0.22). Herds ( n = 11) with a mean linear score ( MLS) less than 3.3 units had the lowest prevalence of Staph. aureus IMI and monthly MLS and the greatest monthly mean milk production compared with other herds grouped by MLS [ MLS 3.31 to 3.99 ( n = 20), MLS 4.00 to 4.46 ( n = 20), MLS > 4.46 ( n = 17), and MLS not available ( n = 33)].

Veterinarski Glasnik		2008		62	1-2	77-83	77	83	Serbian						Examinations were carried out during the period from January 2006 until March 2007 on a total of 449 samples of the cecum of broilers and the cecum and the colon of pigs. These samples included 251 samples originating from broilers and 198 samples of pig cecums and colons. All the listed samples were obtained by scraping the surface of these parts of the digestive system of broilers and pigs. At the site of sampling, the diluted material was sown on a medium (Karmali agar), in order to get individual colonies. After sowing, the bases were placed in anaerobic jars in which microaerophilic conditions were achieved using Campy Pak, BBL bags. On arrival at the laboratory, the jars containing the sown bases were placed in a thermostat, at a temperature of 42 degrees C for 48 hours for the purpose of incubation. Following incubation, the grown colonies were examined macroscopically, and then microscopic preparations were made from them, which were stained with 2% carbol fuchsin after drying and fixation. Those isolates which were in the form of a comma, the letter S, or gull's wings in the microscopic preparations were considered Campylobacter species (Figures 1 and 2). The isolated thermophilic campylobacteria were identified using conventional and commercial biochemical tests API Campy, manufactured by Bio Merieux, France. With the application of these microbiological methods, thermophilic Campy/obacter species were isolated from 203 (80.88%) of the 251 samples of broiler cecums. Furthermore, thermophilic campylobacteria were isolated from 153 (77.27%) of the 198 samples from the cecum and colon of pigs taken within these investigations. The obtained results indicate that there is a somewhat greater prevalence of these bacteria among the broilers. However, such a high percentage of both broilers and pigs colonized by thermophilic Campylobacter species could pose a serious problem, in particular when it is known that infections of humans caused by the consumption of insufficiently thermally processed meat of broilers or pigs are not infrequent.

R. A. Experimental Institute for Olive Growing for many years has been performing a large investigation in order to detect sources of genetic resistance in olive germplasm. In the present study we observed the behavior related to the olive fly (Bactrocera oleae) infestation and Camarosporium dalmaticum infection of ten olive cultivars farmed under the same agronomic and climatic conditions in Calabria, Southern Italy. The sampling and the data collecting were carried out in three different ripening times. The drupe amount of oleuropein and cyanidine was detected by laboratory analyses in order to verify a possible correlation between these molecules and the level of infestation/infection of the above-mentioned parasites. The obtained data were submitted to analysis of variance. In relation to the fungal infection the results displayed that cvs Tonda nera dolce showed the lowest susceptibility, while the cv Giarraffa turned out to be the most susceptible. The less susceptible cultivars to the phytophagous were Tonda nera dolce and Bhardi Tirana. Since the less susceptible cultivar to olive fly attacks are the same observed in relation to the susceptibility to olive fruit rot, it is suggested a relation between the olive fly infestation and the fungal infection. It suggests the utility to achieve these results both to transfer directly to the farmers' world and to emphasize ecosystem health and biodiversity conservation.

As a result of the link between Scrapie, BSE and CJD, a public debate started on the potential risk by consuming meat from animals in these stocks. The consumer worries caused by this debate, gave as a result that the industry itself chose to condemn all of the 70,000 carcasses, although they were approved by the public food control with full support from the entire Norwegian scientific group. The article describes parts of the debate, what we learnt, and it concludes that coopereation between all parties involved together with risk communication is important, but difficult.

J		Article		Diversity and population dynamics of Penicillium spp. on apples in pre- and postharvest environments: consequences for decay development		Amiri, A. (amiri@ccr.jussieu.fr) ; Bompeix, G.									Plant Pathology (Oxford)		2005	February 2005	54	1	74-81	74	81	English	print					Isolates of Penicillium spp. were collected regularly from 2001 to 2003 from the surfaces of apple fruit pre- and postharvest, and from the atmosphere of orchards and storage rooms in France. Penicillium spp. were not detected from the atmosphere of conventional orchards, while their density did not exceed 50 spores m-3 in the atmosphere of organically managed orchards. Penicillium spp. were seldom detected on apple surfaces in the orchard. The density of Penicillium on apples increased from 10 to 50 spores cm-2 after 1 month in storage to 300-400 spores cm-2 after 6 months. The level of airborne Penicillium increased by up to 2 x 104 and 2.5 x 103 spores m-3 within nondisinfected and previously disinfected warehouses, respectively. Penicillium expansum (30-62%) and P. solitum (6-45%) were the most prevalent species on apple or in storage rooms. Other species of Penicillium isolated included P. commune, P. verrucosum, P. chrysogenum, P. rugulosum and P. digitatum. Apple fruit were also surveyed for wounds and the number of open lenticels using the sulphur dioxide test. The incidence of wounding at harvest varied from 12 to 36%, depending on cultivar and locality. When apples were inoculated at harvest by either aqueous or aerial inoculum of P. expansum, the decay incidence was constantly higher than the incidence of wounding. The number of open lenticels per cm2 of apple surface varied from 0.5 on cv. Boskoop to 4.4 on cv. Golden Delicious. An average of 13 and 2.1% of lenticels, respectively, were infected when they were inoculated by P. expansum and P. verrucosum. Cultivars of apple fruit that showed a greater number of open lenticels, combined with a large diameter varying from 100 to 200 mum, were more susceptible to P. expansum.

J		Article		Current status of the lynx (Lynx lynx) in Slovakia		Hell, Pavel; Slamecka, Jaroslav									Prirodovedne Prace Ustavu Akademie Ved Ceske Republiky v Brne		1996		30	3	64-78	64	78	English						Populations of the Carpathian lynx (Lynx lynx carpathica Kratochvil et Stollmann, 1963) became almost extinct in Slovakia, by shooting, 75 years ago. Subsequently, numbers of lynx in Slovakia have increased again and the distribution range extended, owing, to the introduction of legal protection. Protection of the lynx had been discontinued in 1955 and it was introduced again in 1975, as a consequence of the observed decline in numbers. The lynx is now protected from the 1st of March to the 15th of September. This period of protection, however, does not seem to be appropriate, and the period from the 16th of March to the 31st of December is now proposed. The present range of the-lynx in Slovakia extends over an area of woodland of 13 700 km-2 and the total population size is estimated to range between 400 and 500 individuals. In 1955 to 1994, the annual mean harvest rate was 74.83 individuals i.e. one individual per 183 km-2 of woodland area on average. The total official bag was 2993 lynx during the whole period. Furthermore, certain individuals dispersed from Slovakia to Moravia and even to Hungary and Austria. Successful hunting management of this predator is believed to be feasible at this time. This is backed up by the fact that the bag of lynx increased 5.2 times during the period from the late 1920's to 1991 and, in the same time interval, production of hunted game ungulates increased 13.5 times. Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) appears to be the preferred prey species of lynx and the losses caused by lynx to sheep breeding are low in Slovakia at present. Numbers of lynx now appear to have declined again in Slovakia, the annual harvest having decreased from 105 individuals in 1991 to 44 individuals in 1994. This decline is particularly caused by increasing hunting pressure, stimulated by the attractiveness of the rare and valuable trophy of lynx, and also by the rapid reduction in the food base, resulting from a decrease in numbers of grazing sheep. The main causes of the decrease in numbers of prey species are both poaching and the economic recession in agriculture. In this contribution, more effective protection and hunting management of the lynx is proposed. It is emphasised that were the source of individuals used in re-introduction efforts performed in Slovenia, Germany, France, and the Czech Republic (the Sumava Mts.).	Inst.

J	12680856	Article		Which factors explain the lower prevalence of atopy amongst farmers' children?		Remes, S. T. (Sami.Remes@ktl.fi) ; Iivanainen, K.; Koskela, H.; Pekkanen, J.									Clinical and Experimental Allergy		2003	April 2003	33	4	427-434	427	434	English	print					Background: The inverse association between farming and atopy in children has been attributed to microbial exposure, especially through livestock. Very little is known about other potential explanatory factors. Objective: To explore potential differences in lifestyle and environmental factors between farmer and non-farmer families, and whether these factors could explain the association between farming and childhood atopy. Methods: A cross-sectional study, including 366 farmers' and 344 non-farmers' children in eastern Finland. Information regarding exposure and background characteristics was gathered by a written questionnaire. Atopy was defined as having one or more positive skin prick test reactions (>3 mm) against the six common aeroallergens. Results: Regardless of the current farming type, atopy was less frequent among the farmers' children than the non-farmers' children (aOR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40-0.78). Remarkable differences were seen in many lifestyle factors (including diet) between the farmer and non-farmer families, but only a few of the explored factors were associated with atopy. The frequency of current livestock contacts seemed to have an inverse, dose-dependent association with atopy (aOR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22-0.97 for daily vs. no contact). Having lived on a dairy farm in infancy (aOR 0.51, 95% CI 0.28-0.93), or having had cats or dogs in infancy (aOR 0.60, 95% CI 0.42-0.85), decreased the risk of atopy at school age. The inverse association between farming and atopy was not explained by the sociodemographic factors, or by differences in conventional risk factors of atopy. Animal contacts explained partially, but not completely, the association. Conclusion: Higher frequency of animal contacts is one factor, but probably not the only one, explaining the inverse association of farming and atopy in children. The importance of early life exposures may have recently been over-emphasized, and current exposures discounted, when studying the risk factors of childhood atopy.	Remes, S.

J	16257579	Article	Literature Review	Human Mycobacterium bovis infection in the United Kingdom: Incidence, risks, control measures and review of the zoonotic aspects of bovine tuberculosis		de la Rua-Domenech, Ricardo (ricardo.delaruadomenech@defra.gsi.gov.uk)									Tuberculosis (Amsterdam)		2006	MAR 2006	86	2	77-109	77	109	English						Amongst the members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), M. tuberculosis is mainly a human pathogen, whereas M. bovis has a broad host range and is the principal agent responsible for tuberculosis (TB) in domestic and wild mammals. M. bovis also infects humans, causing zoonotic TB through ingestion, inhalation and, less frequently, by contact with mucous membranes and broken skin. Zoonotic TB is indistinguishable clinically or pathologically from TB caused by M. tuberculosis. Differentiation between the causative organisms may only be achieved by sophisticated laboratory methods involving bacteriological culture of clinical specimens, followed by typing of isolates according to growth characteristics, biochemical properties, routine resistance to pyrazinamide (PZA) and specific non-commercial nucleic acid techniques. All this makes it difficult to accurately estimate the proportion of human TB cases caused by M. bovis infection, particularly in developing countries. Distinguishing between the various members of the MTBC is essential for epidemiological investigation of human cases and, to a lesser degree, for adequate chemotherapy of the human TB patient. Zoonotic TB was formerly an endemic disease in the UK population, usually transmitted to man by consumption of raw cows' milk. Human infection with M. bovis in the UK has been largely controlled through pasteurization of cows' milk and systematic cutting of cattle reacting to compulsory tuberculin tests. Nowadays the majority of the 7000 cases of human TB annually reported in the UK are due to M. tuberculosis acquired directly from an infectious person. In the period 1990-2003, between 17 and 50 new cases of human M. bovis infection were confirmed every year in the UK. This represented between 0.5% and 1.5% of all the culture-confirmed TB cases, a proportion similar to that of other industrialized countries. Most cases of zoonotic TB diagnosed in the UK are attributed to (i) reactivation of long-standing latent infections acquired before widespread adoption of milk pasteurization, or (ii) M. bovis infections contracted abroad. Since 1990, only one case has been documented in the UK of confirmed, indigenous human M. bovis infection recently acquired from an animal source. Therefore, for the overwhelming majority of the population, the risk of contracting M. bovis infection from animals appears to be extremely low. However, bovine TB is once again a major animal health problem in the UK. Given the increasing numbers of cattle herds being affected each year, physicians and other public health professionals must remember that zoonotic TB is not just a disease of the past. A significant risk of M. bovis infection remains in certain segments of the UK population in the form of (i) continuing on-farm consumption of unpasteurized cows' milk, (ii) retail sates by approved establishments of unpasteurized milk and dairy products and (iii) occupational exposure to infectious aerosols from tuberculous animals and their carcases.

A.; Collet, Bertrand; Snow, Michael									Diseases of Aquatic Organisms		2008	JUL 7 2008	80	2	137-144	137	144	English						A survey was undertaken to determine the potential distribution of viral haemorrhagic septicaerma virus (VHSV) in marine cage-based salmonid farms in Scotland. A rapid, accurate and sensitive quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay was developed, targeting a conserved region of the nucleoprotein (N) gene of the virus. The qRT-PCR assay was shown to be more sensitive than the conventional VHSV RT-PCR. A validation protocol included several different virus isolates as the target and confirmed that the assay could detect all European VHSV genotypes (I, II and III). Both endogenous and exogenous controls were designed to control for integrity of template and distinguish between true VHSV positives and contamination with the positive control material. In total, the universal European VHSV qRT-PCR assay with exogenous positive control was applied to screen 2040 individual Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and 150 individual rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. No evidence of the presence of VHSV in association with either salmonid species in Scottish marine farms was detected. However, both marine Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout are still considered possible carriers of VHSV, which remains a potential threat to freshwater farming. Therefore, a continued surveillance of these species in marine environment is recommended.

J		Article		Epidemiology and control of Botrytis cinerea in tomato crops grown under cover in Greece		Pappas, A. C.									Bulletin OEPP		2000	Juin, 2000	30	2	269-274	269	274	English	print					Out-of-season tomatoes grown in unheated glasshouses in Greece annually suffer considerable losses from grey mould induced by Botrytis cinerea. Characteristic soft rots of young fruit by the calyx end, flower abortions and stem lesions or cankers are the most commonly occurring symptoms of the disease. Severe ghost spots on fruit only appear when fungicides inhibiting spore germination are not applied. Conidia produced on plant debris of the previous year's crop serve as primary inoculum. Disease starts in late autumn, increases rapidly during the winter period and ceases abruptly at the end of April. Infections caused by isolates resistant to dicarboximides or to both dicarboximides and benzimidazoles are uncommon at the beginning of each new crop cycle. These increase substantially as the season progresses and decline after cessation of fungicide sprays. By contrast, infections caused by benzimidazole-resistant strains are stable throughout the growing season. Efficient disease control implies use of proper glasshouse covering material, adequate indoor air circulation, partial night heating, strict indoor and outdoor hygiene and regular fungicide sprays. When disease pressure is low, application only of conventional compounds like dichlofluanid and chlorothalonil is recommended. Under conditions favourable to Botrytis infections, mixtures of conventional compounds with reduced strength specific botryticides should preferably be applied. Such regimes efficiently minimize losses from fungicide resistance development and ghost spot.	Pappas, A.

Journal of Comparative Pathology		2001	November, 2001	125	4	292-303	292	303	English	print					Post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) is a comparatively new disease of swine, and known to occur in France since 1996. A porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is found in the lesions of affected piglets. Six piglets aged 10-13 weeks were obtained from a French PMWS-affected farm. Two showing characteristic signs of PMWS (palor, weakness and emaciation) remained in poor condition and were finally killed 6 and 9 days after their arrival in the experimental unit. Tissue homogenates from these two piglets were used to reproduce mild PMWS in specific pathogen-free (SPF) piglets. This mild PMWS consisted of pyrexia (up to 41.7degreeC) and growth retardation (up to 30% of weight reduction compared with controls) commencing 1 week after infection and lasting 3 weeks. In seven additional trials, pyrexia, growth retardation and lesions characteristic of PMWS were consistently produced in SPF and conventional piglets. However, only four of 55 inoculated SPF piglets (7.2%) showed severe wasting disease. One died and the others had to be killed 3 to 4 weeks after inoculation. None of the inoculated animals developed antibodies to any common swine viruses or bacteria, but clear evidence of PCV2 seroconversion was obtained. Our results therefore strongly suggest that PCV2 is the primary aetiological agent of PMWS.

J	18042372	Article		Assessment of chemical and biochemical stabilization of organic C in soils from the long-term experiments at Rothamsted (UK)		De Nobili, M. (denobili@uniud.it) ; Contin, M.; Mahleu, N.; Randall, E. W.; Brookes, P. C.									Waste Management		2008		28	4	723-733	723	733	English						Biological and chemical stabilization of organic C was assessed in soils sampled from the long-term experiments at Rothamsted (UK), representing a wide range of carbon inputs and managements by extracting labile, non-humified organic matter (NH) and humic substances (HS). Four sequentially extracted humic substances fractions of soil organic matter (SOM) were extracted and characterized before and after a 215-day laboratory incubation at 25 degrees C from two arable soils, a woodland soil and all occasionally stubbed soil. The fractions corresponded to biochemically stabilised SOM extracted in 0.5 M NaOH (free fulvic acids (FA) and humic acids (HA)) and chemically plus biochemically stabilised SOM extracted from the residue with 0.1 M Na4P2O7 Plus 0.1 M NaOH (bound FA and HA). Our aim was to investigate the effects of chemical and biochemical stabilization on carbon sequestration. The non-humic to humic (NH/H) C ratio separated the soils into two distinct groups: arable soils (unless fertilised with farmyard manure) had an NH/H C ratio between 1.05 and 0.71, about twice that of the other soils (0.51-0.26). During incubation a slow, but detectable, decrease in the NH/H C ratio occurred in soils of C input equivalent or lower to 4 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), whereas the ratio remained practically constant in the other soils. Before incubation the free to bound humic C ratio increased linearly (R-2 = 0.91) with C inputs in the soils from the Broadbalk experiment and decreased during incubation, showing that biochemical stabilization is less effective than chemical stabilization in preserving humic C. Changes in delta C-13 and delta N-15 after incubation were confined to the free FA fractions. The delta C-13 of free FA increased by 1.48 and 0.80 parts per thousand, respectively, in the stubbed and woodland soils, indicating a progressive biological transformation. On the contrary, a decrease was observed for the bound FA of both soils. Concomitantly, a Delta delta N-15 of up to +3.52 parts per thousand was measured after incubation in the free FA fraction and a -2.58 Delta delta N-15 in the bound FA. These changes, which occurred during soil incubation in the absence of C inputs, indicate that free FA fractions were utilised by soil microorganisms, and bound FA were decomposed and replaced, in part, by newly synthesized FA.The (13)CPMAS-TOSS NMR spectra of free HA extracted before and after 215 days of incubation were mostly unchanged. In contrast, changes were evident in bound HA and showed an increase in aromatic C after incubation. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J		Article		Soil structure and characteristics of organic matter in two orchards differing in earthworm activity.		Jongmans, A. G. (toine.jongmans@wur.nl) ; Pulleman, M. M.; Balabane, M.; van Oort, F.; Marinissen, J. C. Y.									Applied Soil Ecology		2003	November 2003	24	3	219-232	219	232	English	print					By consuming plant remains and soil, earthworms incorporate organic matter (OM) into the soil and form biogenic soil structures, which can affect OM dynamics. We carried out a (micro)morphological study of soil structure development and OM distribution in two orchards (45 year) in a Dutch calcareous marine loam: RI- without, and KR+ with high earthworm activity, the result of different levels of heavy metal contamination from fungicides. In both soils, sedimentary-stratification was absent to 60 cm depth and equal amounts of biogenic calcite spheroids were counted, suggesting similar earthworm activity in the past. In RI- the current vol.% of worm-worked groundmass in thin sections was 6% in the Ah and 7% in the Bw horizon compared with 51% in the Ah and 16% in the Bw horizon of KR+. Disappearance of earthworms with time in RI- gave rise to a compacted physicogenic soil structure with angular and prismatic aggregates and the absence of earthworm biopores. Due to restricted fragmentation and incorporation of OM fragments in casts, a litter layer formed at the soil surface. OM coatings were present in fissures and root pores of the Ah horizon, indicating the absence of mixing of organic and mineral soil materials. OM fragments were relatively coarse (>50 mum) and heterogeneously distributed through the Ah groundmass. Stronger decalcification in RI- than in KR+ could be ascribed to higher production of organic acids in the litter layer of RI- and the absence of soil homogenisation by earthworms. In KR+ earthworm activity was high, which has resulted in a biogenic structure with granular and subangular blocky aggregates and many worm casts and biopores. Particulate OM was relatively fine (<50 mum) and encapsulated with clayey material in casts and micro-aggregates. The organic C content was not significantly (P<0.05) higher in the Ah horizon of KR+, than in the Ah horizon of RI- (15.7 and 13.7 g kg-1, respectively). The lower C mineralization rates in KR+ below 6 cm depth, however, might be an indication of higher microbial substrate-use efficiency or physical protection of OM against decomposition. The latter explanation would accord with the observed encapsulation of OM in micro-aggregates, and with studies on other management systems that favour biogenic aggregate formation. The quality of the soil macro- and microstructures, degree of soil compaction and decalcification and soil OM dynamics were strongly determined by the occurrence of earthworms in soils.	Jongmans, A.

The parasite appeared in juvenile fish only and at low water temperatures (ltoreq 5degree C). The most prominent external macroscopical clinical signs of disease were thickened fins that gave the tips a pronounced greyish opaque appearance often in combination with signs of fin rot/fin erosion. The gills were swollen and pale and could also be necrotic. Examination of fresh mounts and tissues prepared for light and electron microscopy showed vacuolated spherical spores typical for parasites of the genus Dermocystidium. Irregularly vacuolated spores with 1 or multiple nuclei were also observed. Histological examination of infected salmon indicated concurrent Flexibacter sp. infection that was verified in Gram-negative stained imprints. The present finding is the first observation of Dermocystidium in Sweden. In addition, this is the first record of a Dermocystidium-like agent that occurs freely in the mucus and epidermis of freshwater teleosts.	Dep. Parasitol., Natl. Veterinary Inst. Swedish Univ.

During the past 20 years there has been a dramatic resurgence or emergence of epidemic arboviral diseases affecting both humans and domestic animals. Many factors play important roles in the emergence of arboviral diseases like Yellow Fever, Dengue, West Nile encephalitis, and of other diseases such as malaria and leishmaniasis in countries where they have not been previously encountered and in the increase in incidences where they have been under control. Some of these are demographic factors such as global population increase and uncontrolled urbanization; social changes such as modern transportation, human encroachment on natural disease hotspots; changes in agricultural activities such as the use of new irrigation techniques; deforestation; genetic changes in the pathogens; preventive measures and probably global climate changes. Mosquitoes are among the most important vectors carrying viruses belonging to Alphavirus, Flavivirus, Bunyavirus and Phlebovirus genera. All of the above factors have contributed to the increase in mosquito populations and closer contact between humans and mosquito vectors. West Nile virus notable after the epidemic of 1996 in Romania in Europe is one of the latest examples indicating that viruses can jump continents and produce epidemics. In this review article, the distribution of West Nile virus and its principal vectors and also its importance by means of public health, have been discussed.

Camps									European Journal of Soil Science		2008	DEC 2008	59	6	1096-1110	1096	1110	English						The objective of this study was to determine to what extent the attenuation or loss of andic soil properties caused by land use change - from forest (FOR, average C content 118.2 +/- 23.7 g kg(-1)) to agricultural land (AGR, average C content 55.7 +/- 16.7 g kg(-1)) use - is reflected in soil organic matter (SOM) at the molecular level. For this, NaOH-extractable SOM of A horizons from 17 soils developed on amphibolitic parent material in NW Spain was studied by pyrolysis gas chromatography spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). We also included two buried andic A horizons (PAL, 2200 cal yr BP in age) on the same parent material, as a reference for the molecular composition of SOM from soils without recent litter additions. Organic matter of PAL soils had a composition largely different from that of superficial soils (FOR and AGR), with an important relative contribution of microbial polysaccharides and N-compounds, and an absence of compounds that characterize fresh plant litter (e.g. lignins). In the superficial soils, the relative contribution of lignin-derived compounds was greater in AGR than in FOR soils. Differences were also observed in the relative contribution of aliphatic compounds, FOR soils being enriched in this type of components compared with AGR soils. The results indicated that land use change from FOR to AGR, which was accompanied by a decrease in total SOM, resulted in an enrichment in primary SOM.

Samples of the organic layers (Oi and Oe-Oa) and the mineral soil (0-5, 5-10, 10-20, and 10-30cm) were taken in fall 1999 and analyzed for their contents of organic C and total N, hot-water-extractable organic C and N (HWC and HWN), KCl-extractable organic C and N (C-org(KCl) and N-org(KCl) NH4+-N and NO3--N, microbial-biomass C and N, and activities ot beta-glucosidase and L-asparaginase. With exception of the HWC, all investigated C and N pools showed a clear response to tilling, which was most pronounced in the Oi horizon. Compared to soils under pine, those under black locust had higher contents of medium- and short-term available C (HWC, C-org(kcl)) and N (HWN, N-org(KCl)), mineral N (NH4+-N, NO3--N), microbial-biomass C and N, and enzyme activities in the uppermost horizons of the soil. The strong depth gradient found for all studied parameters was most pronounced in soils under black locust. Microbial-biomass C and N and enzyme activities were closely related to the amounts of readily mineralizable organic C (HWC and C-org(KCl)). However, the presented results implicate a faster C and N turnover in the top-soil layers under black locust caused by higher N-input rates by symbiotic N-2 fixation.

J		Article		Potential for biodegradation of anthropogenic organic compounds at low temperature in boreal soils		Kurola, Jukka (Jukka.Kurola@Helsinki.fi) ; Salkinoja-Salonen, Mirja									Soil Biology & Biochemistry		2007	MAY 2007	39	5	1206-1212	1206	1212	English						The effect of temperatures of -2.5 to + 20 degrees C on the biodegradation of concentrations 0.2-50 mu g cm(-3) of pentachlorophenol (PCP), phenanthrene, pyrene and 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (TCP) was studied in soils sampled from an agricultural field and a relatively pristine forest in Helsinki, Finland. At the temperatures simulating seasonal variation of boreal soil temperatures [Heikinheimo, M., Fougstedt, B., 1992. Statistic of Soil Temperature in Finland. Meteorological Publications 22. Finnish Meteorological Institute, Helsinki, Finland], the response of mineralization of PCP, phenanthrene and 2,4,5-TCP was the most effective in the rhizosphere fraction of the forest humus soil at the substrate concentrations of <= 5 mu g cm(-3). In the control incubation, performed at constant temperature of + 20 degrees C, the mineralization yields of the model pollutants were highest in the agricultural soil with the highest applied substrate concentration (50 mu g cm(-3)). The results suggest that the high level of pollutant mineralization at + 20 degrees C resulted from the apparent adaptation of the soil microbial community to the high substrate concentration. No such adaptation occurred when the soils were incubated at temperatures simulating the actual boreal soil temperatures. The present results stress the role of adjusting the incubation conditions to environmentally relevant values, when assessing biodegradation of anthropogenic organic compound in boreal soils.

J		Article		Psora globifera in Sweden: A rare lichen only found in Dalsland		Granbo, John									Svensk Botanisk Tidskrift		1999		93	4	201-212	201	212	Swedish	print					The lichen Psora globifera is classed as "endangered" in sweden. Prior to 1998, ten localities had been found (one in Jamtland, nine in Dalsland), most of them in habitats that were kept open by agricultural activities. In recent years it had only been seen on three localities in Dalsland. In 1998 I searched for it on the localities where it had been known to occur, and in 30 additional areas that seemed suitable. Besides from an occurrence in Nord-Trondelag, Norway, adjacent to the record from Jamtland, I found it on eleven localities in Dalsland, six of which were not previously known. Psora globifera is a continental steppe-species, which is found on calcareous, exposed, sloping, easily weathered micaschist bedrock. In the agricultural environment it is threatened by becoming overgrown, and I could only find it on two such localities. On the other localities it grows on exposed shore-cliffs, where it is threatened by exploitation. General measures that has to be taken to protect the species is to maintain and re-establish grazing and hay-making on localities with calcareous micaschist rock. Stigmidium psorae is reported as new to Sweden (on Psora decipiens) and Verrucaria macrostoma as new to Dalsland.

J		Article		Decomposition of organic matter and nutrient mineralisation in wood ant (Formica rufa group) mounds in boreal coniferous forests of different age		Domisch, T. (timo.domisch@metla.fi) ; Ohashi, M.; Finer, L.; Risch, A. C.; Sundstrom, L.; Kilpelainen, J.; Niemela, P.									Biology and Fertility of Soils		2008	FEB 2008	44	3	539-545	539	545	English						Wood ants (Formica rufa group) are dominating ecosystem elements of the boreal region due to their wide and abundant occurrence. They collect and concentrate organic material from the surrounding forest floor by building large above-ground mounds. These mounds have higher temperature and lower water content than the surrounding forest floor. We studied how these peculiar environmental conditions affected mass loss and carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) mineralisation of organic matter in boreal Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.)-dominated mixed forest stands of four different age classes (5-, 30-, 60-, and 100-year-old) situated in eastern Finland using the litter bag technique. Norway spruce needle litter was incubated in inhabited and abandoned wood ant mounds as well as on the surrounding forest floor. We expected decomposition to be extremely slow due to the dryness of the mounds. Mass losses inside inhabited mounds were lower compared to the surrounding forest floor (on average 30 vs 50% after 2 years) but not as low as we expected, which might be a result of ant and microbial activity in the mounds. Decomposition in the abandoned mounds proceeded similarly as on the forest floor. Nutrient mineralisation proceeded more slowly in the ant mounds than on the surrounding forest floor. Mineralisation occurred for all studied nutrients in the ant mounds, except for N, which net amount remained stable during the years of the experiment. When wood ant mounds are abandoned and their porous and dry structure is no longer maintained by the ants, their decomposition is accelerated, and nutrients may be available for uptake by plants, although the nutrient mineralisation seems still to remain lower compared to the surrounding forest floor. However, eventually the mound material will be decomposed and nutrients mineralised, thus providing a nutrient hot spot increasing the heterogeneity of forest floor nutrient availability.

J		Article		The Stiphoutse Bossen: Mycological research in a nutshell		Lammers, Henk; Raaijmakers, Leon									Coolia		1994		37	3	104-113	104	113	German						The Stiphoutse Bossen is an area of 2 times 2 km-2, situated on Pleistocene soils in the eastern part of the province of Noord-Brabant. It consists of planted coniferous and deciduous woods and avenues, together with some surrounding farmland and heathland. The vegetation is varied, and there are many different biotopes. From 1985 to 1993 higher plants, mosses, fungi, slime molds, and lichens were inventoried, of which the fungi weekly. Fungi comprised 1142 species, of which 87% were saprophytes. More species were associated with deciduous trees than with conifers although the area planted with deciduous trees is smaller. Ninety one species are included in the Netherlands Red List of macrofungi. Two species are new to science: Ramgea annulispora, a small ascomycete on pheasant droppings, and an Entoloma-species from a Picea wood. The biotopes and their fungi are treated briefly. This survey shows that intensive and directed searching leads to a large number of species being found. Here the variety of biotopes also contributed to the large number of species. The number of rare and threatened species makes the Stiphoutse Bossen an area of exceptional mycological importance and greatly enhances its overall 'nature value'.

J		Article		Reducing spread of spores of common bunt disease (Tilletia tritici) via combining equipment		Kristensen, Lars; Borgen, Anders									Biological Agriculture and Horticulture		2001		19	1	9-18	9	18	English	print					The disease common bunt (Tilletia tritici syn. caries) has become a more frequent problem in winter wheat in Europe during the last 15 years. In organic fanning, common bunt causes serious problems for seed producers, and many seed lots are discarded due to contamination with Tilletia tritici. Owing to the biology of Tilletia tritici, with spores loosely attached to the surface of the grain, there is a risk that spores can be disseminated via grain handling equipment, including combine harvesters. Preventive efforts should focus on the role of grain handling equipment and how the fungus life cycle can be broken. The dissemination of spores via the combiner after harvesting infected fields has been investigated. Six trials were conducted over three years, counting the number of spores in up to seven emptyings of the combiner. Up to four emptyings with non-contaminated grains were needed in order to achieve an acceptably low level of contamination. Using Denmark as a case, several important factors influencing disease spread via harvest equipment are discussed. It is concluded that one easy preventive strategy is to avoid using the first four emptyings of the combiner. This method should always be combined with analysis of seeds for spore load.

Water Science and Technology		2007		56	3	39-48	39	48	English						This paper describes a two-year performance evaluation of four different constructed wetland (CW) treatment systems designed by IRIDRA Srl, located in central Italy. All four CW systems were established to treat wastewater effluent from different tourist activities: (1) one single-stage CW for secondary treatment of domestic, wastewater (30 p.e.) at a holiday farm site; (2) a hybrid compact system consisting,of two stages, a horizontal flow (HF) system followed by a vertical flow (VF) system for the secondary treatment of effluent from a 140 p.e. tourist resort; (3) a single-stage vertical flow (VF) CW for a 100 p.e. mountain shelter; and (4) a pair of single-stage, HF CWs for the secondary treatment of segregated grey and black water produced by an 80 p.e. camping site. These tourism facilities are located in remote areas and share some common characteristics concerning their water management: they have high variability of water consumption and wastewater flow, depending on the season, weather and weekly regularities; they have no connection to a public sewer and most sites are located in a sensitive environment.Total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), ammonium (N-NH4+), nitrate (N-NOx), total nitrogen (Ntot), total, phosphorus (Ptot), total coliform (TC), faecal coliform (FC), E coli removal efficiencies for all four CW systems are presented. The results from this study demonstrate the potential of CWs as a suitable technology for treating wastewater from tourism facilities in remote areas. A very efficient COD reduction (83-95%) and pathogen elimination (3-5 logs) have been achieved. Furthermore, the CWs are easily. maintained, robust (not sensitive to peak flows), constructed with local materials, and operate with relatively low cost.

Diseases of Aquatic Organisms		1995		21	3	187-191	187	191	English						We describe here the serological and antigenic characterization of a group of highly virulent Enterococcus strains that, since 1993, have caused heavy economic losses in turbot Scophthalmus maximus reared in northern and northwestern Spain. Reference Gram-positive strains and the corresponding polyclonal antisera raised against some species of lactic acid bacteria as well as Corynebacterium aquaticum and Renibacterium salmoninarum were included. Agglutination assays demonstrated that regardless of the farm and year of isolation, all strains from turbot were serologically homogeneous. However, a number of cross-reactions occurred among the various groups of bacteria (mainly among Enterococcus, Carnobacterium and Lactobacillus species). Analysis of the surface proteins and western blot assays supported the antigenic homogeneity of the Enterococcus strains isolated from turbot because they all yielded an essentially identical protein pattern (major common bands were 40, 45, and 50 kDa) and reacted similarly with antisera raised against representative strains of this group (there were at least 7 common bands of 20, 25, 30, 40, 45, 57 and 80 kDa), This serological homogeneity suggests that the development of vaccines to control enterococcosis in turbot should be feasible. Irrespective of the source of the polyclonal antisera employed, common immunoreactive proteins were present in all the Gram-positive bacilli and cocci tested. This, together with the cross-agglutination reactions noted among the various bacterial taxa tested, suggests that serological identification of the turbot Enterococcus using polyclonal antisera could be problematical.

ICES Journal of Marine Science		2006	JUN 2006	63	5	775-784	775	784	English						A significant expansion of offshore windpower is expected ill northwestern Europe in the near future. Little is known about the impacts it may have on the marine environment. Here, we investigate the potential for wind turbines to function as artificial reefs and fish aggregation devices (FADs), i.e., whether they would locally increase fish densities or alter fish assemblages. Fish communities and habitat composition were investigated using visual transects at two windpower farms off the southeastern coast of Sweden. central Baltic Sea. Fish abundance was greater in the vicinity of the turbines than in surrounding areas, while species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity (H') were similar. On the monopiles of the turbines, fish community structure was different, and total fish abundance was greater. while species richness and diversity (H') were lower than oil the surrounding seabed. Blue mussels and barnacles covered most of the submerged parts of the turbines. Oil the seabed. more blue mussels and a lesser cover of red algae were recorded around the power plants than elsewhere. Results from this study suggest that offshore windfarms may function as combined artificial reefs and fish aggregation devices for small demersal fish.(c) 2006 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

The research was aimed at: 1. identifying the best tertiary treatment facilities in order to make the effluent in compliance with the current Italian legislation for RWW reuse, 2. evaluating the effects of RWW irrigation on some ornamental, 3. quantifying fertilizing value and environmental impacts of RWW irrigation. In this paper the results of the last year experimental activity are presented. Experimental results indicated that filtration and disinfection with peracetic acid plus UV were very effective in indicator bacteria removal; as a matter of fact, neither Escherichia coli nor Total Coliforms were detected in any samples of pilot plant effluent. Results of an agronomical experiment indicated the suitability of the tertiary effluent for the irrigation: at the end of the growing season a higher (or equal) total dry mass was detected in RWW irrigated plants than well-water (WW) irrigated ones. Finally, the tertiary effluent can be considered as an important source of fertilizer for container-grown plants. As a matter of fact RWW irrigation showed to be able to replace at least one of the traditional fertilization treatments.

J		Article		Investigations on mycorrhizae and fine roots in an area used as forest pasture		Gobl, F.									Phyton (Horn)		1996		36	3	193-204	193	204	English						On the Schulterberg, at an altitude of 1640 m a.s.l. (Achenkirch project area), investigations on mycorrhiza and fine roots were carried out at the end of the 1991 grazing season in an area used as pasture. The evaluation of 900 cylinder samples (100 ml), taken from an area of 400 m-2, showed considerable differences between small forest and pasture sites. Where there were trees the dry weight and the density of mycorrhizae and fine roots were higher. The diversity of the mycorrhizae and their vitality were those of a healthy forest in good condition. In areas used for grazing dead mycorrhizae and fine roots were frequently found. It is assumed that this damage, as well as the resulting poorer vitality, is due to the mechanic stress of the soil caused by grazing cattle or sheep. It is evident that the quantitative features which can be established in respect of mycorrhizae do not provide sufficient information to allow an evaluation of the site quality and that qualitative features must be taken into account for that purpose. No pollutant-related deformation of mycorrhizae was observed. From seed experiments, which can be used to assess natural regeneration, the following results have been obtained: The roots of 2-year old seedlings developed poorly on sites used for grazing, moderately around trees, and well, or even very well, on rotting wood. The feature assessed was the length of the roots. The development of the mycorrhizae also proved to be heavily dependent on the substrate and, therefore, can be used as a site indicator.

J	15172691	Article		Prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter coli isolated from fattening pigs in France		Payot, Sophie (payot@tours.inra.fr) ; Dridi, Sami; Laroche, Michel; Federighi, Michel; Magras, Catherine									Veterinary Microbiology		2004	June 21, 2004	101	2	91-99	91	99	English	print					Campylobacter are a leading cause of human diarrhea. The usual source of infection is contaminated food, particularly poultry but pork has also been described. The veterinary use of antimicrobial drugs has been suggested to be largely responsible for resistance in human isolates of this zoonotic pathogen. A study was carried out to investigate the occurrence and antimicrobial resistance of Camylobacter isolated from French fattening pigs. From March 1998 to June 1999, stomach samples were collected at slaughter from 240 fattening pigs originating front 24 different farms. Half of the pigs were found to be positive for Campylobacter but considerable variation was observed between farms. Isolates all belong to the Campylobacter coli species. Susceptibilities of the strains were determined for five antimicrobial drugs using agar dilution. Resistance to tetracycline and erythromycin was high (79 and 55%, respectively). For nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin and ampicillin, resistance was observed in 34, 15 and 20% of the isolates, respectively. More than one-third of the strains was resistant to at least three antimicrobial drugs. A Thr86Ile modification in GyrA was observed in the enrofloxacin-resistant strains studied. The multiresistant strains analyzed expressed the multidrug transporter CmeB at a high level. Results indicated a high prevalence of C. coli in the stomach of the French pigs examined. In addition, a high proportion of the strains was resistant to antimicrobial drugs, particularly to tetracycline and erythromycin, or were multiresistant. Copyright 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J		Article		The distribution and changes of Phytophthora infestans population in Latvia		Bebre, Gunta; Skrabule, Ilze (skrabuleilze@navigator.lv) ; Osa, Marija									Plant Breeding and Seed Science		2004		50		43-49	43	49	English	print					Potato breeders and phytopathologists have been conducting the studies on Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary at the Priekuli Plant Breeding Station since 1962. The varietal resistance is very important in potato breeding programme. The trials in collaboration with the Institute of Phytopathology of Soviet Union (Russia) were done in 1974-1990. The investigations were focused on races of P. infestans. The changes of races were assessed using a "trap" method, according to the investigation programme, like in each of the republics of the Soviet Union. At the beginning of investigations (1960s and 1970s) races 1, 4 and 1.4 of P. infestans were the predominant ones in Latvia, but in the 1980s complex races 4.10.11, 1.4.7.8.10.11, 1.3.4.7.8.10.11 and 1.2.3.4.7.8.10.11 were more widely distributed. Different foreign varieties, mostly from the Netherlands, were introduced in Latvia in the 1970s. This resulted in a very rapid differentiation of late blight races. The enhanced aggressiveness of P. infestans isolates was due to an increasing number of races in population. The earlier appearance of infection in potato fields was recorded. The presence of a mating type A2 was stated in Latvian samples in 1987. Because all tested races had been recognized in a population, and the conception of resistance breeding had been modified, the trials were stopped in 1990. The resistance based on specific resistance genes was the main direction in the 1960s and 1970s. From the 1980s, importance of the field resistance has greatly increased and this type of resistance is the most significant in the current breeding programme. The trials in organic field proved the acceptable level of field resistance to P. infestans of three medium late varieties: Sigunda (previous name Undine), Bete and Zile. These varieties have been bred at the Priekuli Plant Breeding Station and included into the Latvian Plant Varieties Catalogue.

Of approximately 250 attendees, 227 had consumed dishes offered at the festival, and of these consumers 35 persons fulfilled the outbreak case definition (attack rate of 15.4%). Spatzle (traditional pastalike side dish) was most likely the contaminated part of the incriminated main course (relative risk of 18.9, 95% confidence interval of 4.6 to 76.7; P < 0.001). Thirteen eggs that remained from the preparation of the spatzle were negative for Salmonella when tested individually without shell disinfection, as were 1,200 eggs collected at the egg production plant and examined with shell disinfection. The back-traced egg production farm had been initially certified as Salmonella free by a voluntary quality control program. However, an intensified environmental investigation of the incriminated egg production farm performed in the first quarter of 2006 and based on an appropriate method of sampling revealed Salmonella Enteritidis phage type 4 in 4 of 13 flocks. Although a combination of epidemiological and microbiological investigations allowed elucidation of the mode of spread, no restrictions were placed on the incriminated flocks of laying hens. These flocks were kept in production until they were stalled out due to age in August 2006. In June 2006, a cluster of 23 cases of Salmonella Enteritidis phage type 6 infection was again associated with this egg production farm. Evidence provided by epidemiological analyses is often disregarded by decision makers. However, negative results from microbiological testing of food involved in an outbreak are often weighted as strong evidence against a causal association between that food and the outbreak.

J	9695287	Article		Evaluation and application of ribotyping for epidemiological studies of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae in Denmark		Fussing, Vivian; Barfod, Kristen; Nielsen, Ragnhild; Moller, Kristian; Nielsen, Jens Peter; Wegener, Henrik C.; Bisgaard, Magne									Veterinary Microbiology		1998	May, 1998	62	2	145-162	145	162	English	print					The aim of the present study was to evaluate ribotyping as an epidemiological tool for Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and apply the method in studies of A. pleuropneumoniae infections in Danish pig herds. The evaluation of ribotyping was based on the 13 international reference strains and 106 epidemiologically unrelated Danish field strains representing the nine serotypes of biotype I (1, 2, 5A/B, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, and K2:07) and one serotype 14 of biotype 2. Enzymes CfoI and HindIII were chosen for generation of ribotype patterns. Ribotyping of the reference strains resulted in 10 CfoI types and 11 HindIII types. Ribotyping of the Danish strains resulted in 17 different CfoI ribotypes and 24 different HindIII ribotypes. Combining HindIII- and CfoI-ribotyping divided the Danish strains into 26 different types. The stability, reproducibility and typability of ribotype patterns were good, and the discriminatory power was between 0.85-0.89. The relatively low discriminatory power was caused by four predominant types, containing 61% of the isolates. The typing system was applied in studies of routes of infection of specific pathogen-free (SPF) pig herds and included 112 strains of A. pleuropneumoniae. Airborne transmission from neighboring conventional pig farms was investigated in 12 cases of infected SPF herds. Transmission via vehicles transporting pigs between SPF herds was investigated in nine cases while transmission by trading of pigs between SPF herds was investigated in two cases. Serotype 2 was isolated from all SPF herds included in this study, except one, emphasizing the high prevalence of this serotype in Denmark. By ribotyping, airborne transmission was indicated in five of 12 cases, transmission via pig transporting vehicle was indicated in six of nine cases, and transmission via trading was indicated in one of two cases. In many cases findings of predominant ribotypes made interpretations of suspected routes of transmission difficult. The relationship of strains based on ribotypes was calculated using Dices coefficient and clustered by UPGMA. HindIII ribotypes of serotype 2 strains were closely related, though only showing 43% similarity to HindIII ribotypes of remaining serotypes.	Fussing, Vivian; Dep.

Complete or partial replacement of the soil was generally effective in increasing plant size and fresh weight of both roots and aerial parts. Steam disinfestation of the soil abolished the symptoms of "stanchezza" during the first growth cycle, but its effect was reduced on the second crop. Leaching the substrate with water and deep tilling had no or only limited effect on plant growth. Amendment with a commercial biostimulating product containing organic phenolic compounds had only partial efficacy. Bench solarization was the most effective means of control of the syndrome and its effect continued for the second crop cycle. No significant reduction of "stanchezza" was achieved with broad-spectrum antibiotic or fungicide mixtures. No significant differences were detected between bacterial and fungal populations in a soil with "stanchezza" and a non-cultivated soil. Further investigation is now required to shed light on the mechanisms underlying this emerging phytopathological problem.

J	16303163	Article		Nitrobacter and Nitrospira genera as representatives of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria: Detection, quantification and growth along the lower Seine River (France)		Cebron, Aurelie; Garnier, Josette (josette.garnier@ccr.jussieu.fr)									Water Research		2005	DEC 2005	39	20	4979-4992	4979	4992	English						Pollution from agriculture and urban effluents influences the ecology and biochemical functioning of the Seine River. Nitrification dominates nitrogen transformations downstream of the effluents of the Paris wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) at Acheres, treating, by activated sludge the wastewater of 6.5 million inhabitant equivalents from Paris and its suburbs, without nitrification and denitrification treatment. It discharges effluents containing large amounts of nitrogen, ammonium mostly (similar to 30 mg L-1 N-NH4+ L-1), on average 45 mg L-1 of suspended particulate matter, high quantities of total organic carbon (similar to 30 mg C L-1) largely biodegradable (40%), and high concentration in total phosphorus (similar to 3 mg Tot P L-1), as well as microorganisms. Ammonium, brought into the river system, is slowly nitrified in the lower Seine River and especially in the freshwater estuary. The nitrifying activities can be observed by measuring inorganic nitrogen compound concentrations and potential activities. To understand the contributions of the WWTP effluents, the upstream agricultural runoff water and the Seine tributaries, it is useful to investigate the bacterial community. Whereas ammonia oxidation has been widely studied, the second step, i.e. nitrite oxidation, is less well understood. We have previously analysed the ammonium-oxidizing bacterial (AOB) community in the Seine (Cebron, A., Berthe, T., Garnier, J., 2003. Nitrification and nitrifying bacteria in the lower Seine River and estuary (France). Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 69, 7091-7100; Cebron, A., Coci, M., Garnier, J., Laanbroek, H.J., 2004. DGGE analysis of the ammonia oxidizing bacterial community structure in the lower Seine River: impact of the Paris wastewater effluents. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 70, 6726-6737), and focus here on the composition of the nitrite-oxidizing bacterial (NOB) community. As no general molecular probe targeting all known NOBs is currently available, we chose to target and quantify (by competitive PCR) the two genera Nitrobacter and Nitrospira assumed to be the major players in nitrite oxidation in freshwater environments. Nitrobacter species were dominant in the upstream Seine River basin but Nitrospira was the dominant NOB downstream of the WWTP. These two genera were equally represented in WWTP effluents. In the Seine River estuary, especially in the salinity gradient, the Nitrobacter proportion increases and that of Nitrospira disappears, possibly due dilution by seawater. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

J		Article		The record of nitrate utilization and productivity limitation provided by delta15N values in lake organic matter-A study of sediment trap and core sediments from Baldeggersee, Switzerland		Teranes, Jane L.; Bernasconi, Stefano M.									Limnology and Oceanography		2000	June, 2000	45	4	801-813	801	813	English	print					The response of nitrogen isotopic composition of organic matter to changes in nitrate utilization, N-limitation and lake productivity was studied in Baldeggersee, a small eutrophic lake in central Switzerland. Nitrogen isotope ratios were measured on organic matter accumulation in sediment traps, collected daily from March 1995 through October 1996, and on individually sampled light and dark annual laminae from a 108-yr sediment core sequence (1885-1993). Nitrogen accumulation in the sediment traps averaged 0.04 g N m-2 d-1. delta15N values of the sediment trap material increased from 11permill to 13permill (atmospheric N2) as primary productivity decreased surface water (NO3-) from 1.4 to 0.7 mg N L-1 during the seasonal stratified periods. Very small amounts of isotopically enriched organic matter (delta15N apprx 15-20permill) of heterotrophic and/or detrital origin accumulated in the winter months. Nitrogen accumulation in the core sediments average 4 g N m-2 per year. delta15N values of the sediment core material increased up-core (from delta15N apprx 6permill to delta15N apprx 11permill); several abrupt positive isotope shifts (>2permill) occur in the upper part of the record. Comparison between sediment delta15N values and surface water (NO3-) measurements for the period of 1976-1993 reveals that the abrupt positive delta15N shifts occurred in years where unusually large phytoplankton blooms depleted surface waters nitrate to concentrations of <0.7 mg N L-1. A 3permill negative delta15N shift, observed between 1973-1975 at the time of maximum anoxic conditions and meromixis, can be attributed to phytoplankton incorporation of ammonia, which was present in concentrations of up to 0.7 mg L-1 in the epilimnion. Preservation of isotopic shifts in the sediment core which are clearly related to water column processes, and the similarity of core top delta15N values to the weighted average N-isotopic composition of sediment trap material indicate that the sediment record reliably reflects the surface-generated delta15N signal. Our results from sediment trap and uppermost core samples provide the first conclusive evidence that N-isotopes in lacustrine organic matter record the increasing isotopic enrichment of surface water NO3- due to its utilization by phytoplankton. Artificial aeration of the Baldeggersee bottom water since 1982 has effectively reduced water column anoxia. Thus, water column denitrification, which could considerably increase the isotopic composition of residual nitrate, does not occur in the present lake. Even so, present day nitrogen isotopic values in the sediment core data are higher than most all previous periods suggesting that water column denitrification has never been a dominant influence on sediment delta15N values. Instead, the up-core 6permill increase in delta15N values better corresponds to the documented history of external N-loading from agricultural runoff in the watershed over the last 100 years. These nitrogen sources have characteristically high delta15N values (10-20permill) and could lead to progressive 15N-enrichment of the Baldeggersee dissolved inorganic nitrogen pool.

J		Article		The spread of furunculosis in salmonids in Norwegian rivers		Johnsen, B. O.; Jensen, A. J.									Journal of Fish Biology		1994		45	1	47-55	47	55	English						Furunculosis was first discovered in a fish farm in Norway in 1964, followed in importation of rainbow trout from Denmark. The disease spread to several farms and to wild fish in the River Numedalslagen, occurring there until 1979. It was eradicated at several farms, the last being disinfected in 1969. In 1985, furunculosis was discovered in marine fish farms in Nord-Trondelag, following importation of salmon smolts from Scotland. The disease reached More og Ramsdal in 1988, by which time 32 fish farms were infected in two counties. By the end of 1992, 550 farms were infected. The disease spread concurrently in natural watercourses, from 22 in 1989, to 74 by the end of 1992. Rapid spread of the disease was associated with several factors including escapes from fish farms, possibly via transport of fish between farms, and natural movement of wild fish in the sea. The disease was not associated with particular physical characteristics in these watercourses, but large aggregations of fish beneath waterfalls combined with high water temperature may trigger disease outbreaks. The ecological consequences of furunculosis are not known. However, some river populations of adult salmon, sea trout and brown trout have suffered. Furunculosis may result in serious negative consequences for populations if significant number of the brood stock die before spawning.	Norwegian Inst.

The green algae prevailed in the both transitory zones. The biomass and phytoplankton diversity increased continuously along the transects. The transitory zones showed a maximal biological activity (as chlorophyll a) in the periphyton. Most of the total particulate organic matter (POM) was deposited in the open water of the agricultural system, whereas the highest amount of the POM was found in the transitory zone for the forest system. The principal component analysis (concerning all abiotic and algal variables) did not distinguish the transitory zones from the adjacent zones for both systems. The transitory zones were more similar to the reservoir open water zones than to the streams. This was also confirmed by cluster analysis of phytoplankton composition. This study showed that the transitory zones have more in common with the reservoir open water than with streams.

J		Article		Biological control methods of pest insects in oilseed rape		Hokkanen, H. M. T. (heikki.hokkanen@helsinki.fi)									Bulletin OEPP		2008	APR 2008	38	1	104-109	104	109	English						Parasitoids, predators, insect pathogenic fungi, nematodes and microsporidia have all shown promise in the biological suppression of the key target pest, the pollen beetle Meligethes aeneus in rapeseed, as well as in the control of other rapeseed pests. Under favourable conditions pollen beetles are locally and temporarily already under efficient natural control by one or several of these agents, but overall the pollen beetle remains the number one pest of rapeseed in Finland, as well as elsewhere in Europe. Conservation biological control to enhance natural control appears the most feasible approach to solve the problem. Field and simulation data are used to demonstrate how a simple change in the tillage practice may be enough to obtain efficient control of the pollen beetle. Several other options are, or will be available, subject to successful registration of microbial products based on the fungi Metarhizium anisopliae and Beauveria bassiana, and the nematode Steinernema feltiae. Strategies and methods of applying these agents have been developed to facilitate either inundative treatments, or ecosystem restoration to (re-)establish the presence of these agents in agricultural fields. Critical components of agricultural practice have been identified for maximising control by biological agents within a functioning IPM system.	Hokkanen, H. M.

Veterinary Microbiology		2003	29 April, 2003	92	4	297-309	297	309	English	print					"Norwalk-like viruses" (NLVs) are the most common cause of acute non-bacterial gastroenteritis in humans. Cattle may be a reservoir of NLVs although never bovine NLVs have been found in humans. To gain more insight into the epidemiology of NLV, infections in cattle in The Netherlands were studied. Individual faecal samples from a large dairy herd and 243 pooled samples from veal calf farms were analysed for NLV by RT-PCR. Calves under 3 months of age in the dairy herd were sampled three to five times with 3-week intervals, whereas dairy cattle were sampled twice with a 2-month interval. In 31.6% (77/243) of the veal calf farm samples and in 4.2% (13/312) of the individual dairy cattle samples NLV was detected. The mean age of virus positive dairy cattle was 2.5 months. The highest numbers of NLV positive veal calf farms in The Netherlands were found in the regions with the highest number of veal calf farms. NLV infected veal calf farms were detected in every month throughout the study period. Cattle appeared to be hosts of NLVs, and virus shedding was weakly associated with diarrhoea. Complete ORF2 sequences were obtained from two calf NLVs and phylogenetic analyses suggested that these strains belong to a distinct cluster (GGIII/2) in between GGI and GGII NLVs of humans. Overall, genetic variation between strains as determined by sequence analysis of the P1/P2 capsid region was limited to 14.6%. Our data shows that NLV is endemic in the cattle population in The Netherlands and genetically distinct from NLVs in humans.	van der Poel, Wim H.

C.; Tores, J. A.; de Vicente, A.									Bulletin OEPP		2000	Juin, 2000	30	2	351-356	351	356	English	print					Tomatoes are one of the most important crops in southern Spain, especially during the cold season. As a preliminary step in the design of an integrated disease management programme for tomato, a study on the occurrence of bacterial diseases in tomato houses of Almeria (ES) was carried out during the 1993/1997 growing seasons. Sixty-four bacterial strains were isolated from tomato plants showing symptoms of bacterial diseases and 41 of them (64%) were characterized as pathogenic. The bacterial tomato pathogens most frequently isolated were Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, Pseudomonas corrugata, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato and Xanthomonas vesicatoria. The pathogenicity of the bacterial isolates on tomato was tested by the conventional seedling assay and by an in vitro assay using detached tissues developed in our laboratory. Close correspondence between the two assays was observed. An in vitro detached tissue assay is proposed for determining the pathogenicity of bacterial isolates on tomato.	Cazorla, F.

American Journal of Epidemiology		2005	JUN 1 2005	161	11	1037-1046	1037	1046	English						The aim of this study was to confirm the exposure-dependent reduction in lung cancer risk reported for dairy farmers exposed to endotoxin and to evaluate the consequence of leaving dairy farming and taking employment in industry or services, where exposure to microbial agents is lower. Standardized mortality ratios, with 95% confidence intervals, for 2,561 self-employed dairy farmers were estimated, considering the general population of Veneto, Italy, from 1970 to 1998 as the reference. Sixty-two lung cancer cases, whose information was checked against clinical records, were compared with 333 controls in a cohort-nested case-control study. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were estimated by logistic regression analysis. A downward trend of standardized mortality ratios for lung cancer across tertiles of number of dairy cattle on the farm was significant (p < 0.05) from 1970 to 1984 but not from 1985 to 1998, when most subjects were no longer dairy farmers. Age- and smoking-adjusted odds ratios for lung cancer significantly decreased with increasing number of dairy cattle (p for trend = 0.001) for workers for whom <= 15 but not > 15 years had elapsed from the end of work to the end of follow-up. In conclusion, increased levels of endotoxin (or other associated environmental factors) might be protective against lung cancer; protection diminishes over time after that exposure is removed.

Pathologie Biologie		2005	MAY 2005	53	4	237-243	237	243	French						Procedures applicable in France for the prevention of prion diseases were first implemented in 1995, resulting from the threat of an epidemic extension of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) following contamination resulting from the use of extracted growth hormone. It was found later that the bovine disease could infect humans via foodstuffs, and the human variant of the disease (v-CJD) transmissible through lymphoid formations was described in 1996. This led to generalizing precautions to a larger number of medical interventions, taking into account the risk for a population more broadly exposed to contamination. The principles for managing these new risks are described, as well for the use of medical devices or in patient as pathology laboratories. (c) 2004 Elsevier SAS. Tous droits reserves.

J	11113695	Article		Soil mutagens are airborne mutagens: Variation of mutagenic activities induced in Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100 by organic extracts of agricultural and forest soils in dependence on location and season		Edenharder, R.; Ortseifen, M.; Koch, M.; Wesp, H. F.									Mutation Research		2000	20 December, 2000	472	1-2	23-36	23	36	English	print					As our hypothesis was that soil mutagens are airborne mutagens, possibly modified by soil microorganisms, we checked solvent extracts from agricultural and forest soils collected during late summer in the environment of Mainz, a region highly charged by anthropogenic air pollution, or near Bayreuth, a rural low charged region of Germany, or in a remote region of western Corsica without anthropogenic air pollution for the presence of mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium. Levels of mutagenic activities were quantified by calculation of revertants/g from the initial slope of dose-response curves applying tester strains S. typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100 in the absence and presence of an activation system from rat liver (S9). Three soils from Corsica did not induce mutagenicity under any test condition. However, most soils from Germany exhibited mutagenic activities, though preferentially in strain TA 98, but no statistically significant differences could be detected between 27 soils from the Mainz and nine soils from the Bayreuth regions. On the other hand, no correlation could be detected between the levels of mutagenic activities at any test condition and agricultural practice - rye growing, viniculture, fruit growing, meadow, and fallow - texture of soils - % composition of clay, slit, and sand - or the contents of organic matter. The only significant difference of mutagenicity was, however, found with S. typhimurium TA 98-S9 between forest soils of pHapprx4.0 as compared with agricultural soils of pHapprx7.0. The presence of antimutagens in soil as demonstrated by the course of dose-response curves of the three soils from Corsica may be another possible confounder. Calculation of mean values of mutagenic activities for all soils from Germany gave the following results: S. typhimurium TA 98: 69.7+-153.2 (-S9); 63.0+-176.3 (+S9); S. typhimurium TA 100:-144.7+-399.4 (-S9); 43.3+-172.0 (+S9) revertants/g of dry soil. In another series of experiments, soil mutagenicity in 10 rye fields near Mainz was monitored for 1 year. It became evident that low levels of mutagenic activities in late summer increased during autumn, reached a peak in late winter, and subsequently, decreased during spring and summer. These results agree with the hypothesis of an airborne origin of soil mutagens, deposition, and an adjacent transformation to non-mutagenic compounds by soil microorganisms.

J		Article		Benthic O-2 distribution and dynamics in a Mediterranean lagoon (Thau, France): An in situ microelectrode study		Dedieu, K.

Estuarine Coastal and Shelf Science		2007	APR 2007	72	3	393-405	393	405	English						Benthic oxygen profiles were acquired using microsensors over two seasonal cycles (December 2001, April and August 2002, January and May 2003) at two stations differently affected by shellfish farming activity in the Than lagoon (French Mediterranean coast). This study was part of the Microbent-PNEC Program on the study of biogeochemical processes at the sediment-water interface in an eutrophicated environment. We explored seasonal and spatial heterogeneity as well as the biogeochemical drivers of oxygen uptake, such as in situ temperature, bottom water oxygenation and organic matter deposition. O-2 consumption rates were determined by using a transport-reaction model. Maximum rates were reached in August and May and minimum rates in December, April or January. The effect of oyster farming on oxygen fluxes was clearly identified with higher diffusive oxygen uptake in the station inside the oyster parks (C5; 36.8 +/- 18.5-87.7 +/- 40.8 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), compared with the station lying outside the oyster parks (C4; 8.6 +/- 2.1-30.7 +/- 8.3 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). At C5, the large spatial heterogeneity was statistically concealing temporal variation, whereas a clear statistical difference between cold and warm periods appeared at C4. In these lagoon sediments, the seasonal dynamics of diffusive oxygen demand and consumption rates were mainly driven by seasonal temperature variation at both stations, as well as by seasonal organic matter delivery to the sediment at the station located outside the oyster parks. In the station located below the oyster parks, seasonal variation of organic matter deposition was dampened by oyster filtering activity. Seasonal temperature variation thus appeared as the major driver of oxygen dynamics in this station. Measurements of total O-2 uptake rates indicated a significant fraction of microbial recycling and diffusive transport in oxygen uptake at the station located close to the oyster parks. In the open water site, fauna-mediated O-2 transport prevailed in April 2002 (cold conditions), whereas the microbial recycling seemed to dominate in May 2003 (warm conditions).

Regina Bianca to determine whether it could act as an antagonistic endophyte of the downy mildew agent Plasmopara viticola. The occurrence of this fungus was ascertained in 34 grapevines (cultivars Regina Bianca, Catarratto and Insolia) representing all the grapevine plants in an experimental vineyard located in Sicily and which had never been treated with any fungicides. The isolation frequency of the endophytic Acremonium strains was assessed in several plant organs by means of monthly samplings over a 2-year period. The endophyte was found in all the grapevines, with higher frequencies in the cv. Regina Bianca in the buds, and in the cooler months of the year. All the strains collected from the leaves, and most of the strains from the buds of cv. Insolia were identified as A. byssoides by conventional means. The presence and spatial distribution of A. byssoides was determined in asymptomatic or P. viticola-infected leaves of the grapevine cv. Insolia using an optimised staining technique and differential interferential contrast light microscopy, as well as laser scanning microscopy. A. byssoides was a natural colonizer of grapevines and actively parasitized P. viticola. Culture filtrates and the crude extract of A. byssoides obtained from a cv. Insolia foliar strain, completely inhibited P. viticola sporangia.

J	7793949	Article		Evidence for the Existence of Distinct Populations of Vibrio anguillarum Serogroup O1 Based on Plasmid Contents and Ribotypes		Pedersen, Karl; Larsen, Jens Laurits									Applied and Environmental Microbiology		1995		61	6	2292-2296	2292	2296	English						A total of 103 Vibrio anguillarum serogroup O1 strains displaying 15 different plasmid profiles were characterized with respect to biochemical properties and ribotypes. The results confirmed that V. anguillarum O1 is a biochemically homogeneous group. The 103 strains could be allocated to three main clusters with high similarity coefficients. None of the biochemical properties were connected with the presence of plasmids. In total, 12 different ribotypes were demonstrated, with HindIII being used as the restriction enzyme. Forty of the strains were isolated from the same Danish fish farm, some from the kidneys of diseased fish and some from the environment, and some strains were isolated from the mucus, gills, and feces of healthy fish. Nineteen of these isolates possessed the 67-kb virulence plasmid alone or in combination with other plasmids, while 21 had no plasmids. All strains isolated from the kidneys of diseased fish on this farm had plasmids. Irrespective of their origin (kidneys, gills, or mucus), all 19 strains carrying the 67-kb virulence plasmid had the same ribotype, profile 1, while isolates without plasmids belonged to five different profiles, all different from profile 1. These results suggest that pathogenic V. anguillarum O1 strains possessing a virulence plasmid and nonpathogenic strains without plasmids from a small geographical area and even from the same fish may constitute two essentially distinct populations. Thus, it may be suggested that an exchange of virulence plasmids among strains is unlikely to occur in vivo.	Pedersen, Karl; Lab. Fish Dis., Dep. Vet. Microbiol., Royal Vet. Agric.

Control of these outbreaks in birds would probably lead to reduced transmission of the avian virus to humans. This study presents a mathematical model based on stochastic farm-to-farm transmission that incorporates flock size and spatial contacts to evaluate the impact of control strategies. Fit to data from the recent epidemic in the Netherlands, we evaluate the efficacy of control strategies and forecast avian influenza dynamics. Our results identify high-risk areas of spread by mapping of the farm level reproductive number. Results suggest that an immediate depopulation of infected flocks following an accurate and quick diagnosis would have a greater impact than simply depopulating surrounding flocks. Understanding the relative importance of different control measures is essential for response planning.

Supervie, Virginie (vsupervie@ccde.chups.jussieu.fr) ; Costagliola, Dominique									Comptes Rendus Biologies		2006	FEB 2006	329	2	106-116	106	116	English						In a previous study, we showed that estimates of the BSE epidemic in France were censored by cattle mortality and by a lack of diagnosis. Indeed, we estimated that 51 300 cattle were infected by the BSE agent between 1987 and 1997, whereas only 103 clinical BSE cases were detected by the passive surveillance system up to June 2000. The question thus arises as to the part played by each form of censorship in this underestimation. Here, using an updated cattle survival distribution, we estimated that 44 800 cattle were infected by the BSE agent between 1987 and 1997, and that 7100 of them showed clinical signs of BSE up to June 2000, showing the low efficiency of the surveillance system. Moreover, between 2087 and 5980 'infectious' cattle, with clinical or preclinical BSE, entered the human food chain before July 1996, the date of the ban on specified bovine offal.

J		Article	Literature Review	Mad cow disease		Campbell, Peter N.									Acta Biologica Szegediensis		2006		50	3-4	89-94	89	94	English						The correct name for Mad Cow Disease is Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) and I will use this abbreviation throughout the text. BSE was first detected in England in 1985. Since then millions of cattle have been slaughtered either because they were infected or for precautionary measures. Payment for compensation to the farmers has cost the UK Government some Euro 6 billion. Although the UK has been the main site for BSE other countries have had BSE and all countries are forewarned. It seems certain that BSE has been transmitted to humans which has emphasised the necessity to protect the public from further infections. The many measures taken will be described. Basic research continues in an attempt to understand the science behind the advent of BSE but there remain many puzzling aspects. Some success has been achieved in identifying infected animals before the clinical symptoms appear. Naturally many professional people have been criticised for the spread of BSE and interesting lessons are being learnt from the links between politicians and scientists. There is little doubt that the standing of scientists in the public eye has been detrimentally affected by BSE.

Here, multilocus fragment analysis of 3 microsatellite loci (ML1, ML2, and gp60) was used to subtype strains from sporadic cases of cryptosporidiosis in Wales and northwest England. Of 72 strains of C. parvum, 63 were typeable at all 3 loci, forming 31 subtypes. These strains formed 3 broad clusters, representing 74.6%, 20.6%, and 4.8% of typeable strains. Of 118 C. hominis strains, 106 were typeable at all 3 loci, forming 9 subtypes; however, 90% belonged to the same subtype. Analysis with epidemiologic data found an association between strains from case-patients who reported contact with farm animals and individual C. parvum microsatellite alleles. The strongest association was with ML1; all strains from case-patients that reported farm animal contact had the same allele (ML1-242). Microsatellite typing of C. parvum provides valuable additional information on the epidemiology of this Dathoaen.

In this paper, the area affected by fish farm and sewage derived particulate nitrogen in the Murter Sea and semi-enclosed Pirovac Bay (central Adriatic, Croatia) was assessed using the stable nitrogen isotopic composition (delta N-15) in particulate organic matter (POM) and benthic sessile invertebrates (Aplysina aerophoba, Balanus perforatus and Anemonia sulcata) in the exposed areas compared to an unpolluted reference site. The results suggest that increased delta N-15 values in the POM and biota in the impacted areas are predominantly due to nitrogen losses through feed wastage and fish excretion (faeces), but also due to the sewage discharge into the marine coastal ecosystems. The delta N-15 values of the selected organisms were significantly higher around fish cages, as well as at sites polluted by urban waste, compared to the reference site and some other pristine offshore locations. The N-15 enrichments of A. aerophoba, A. sulcata and B. perforatus collected around fish cages compared to the reference location were up to 6.8, 6.5 and 5.2 parts per thousand, respectively, which exceeds the natural variability. While the delta N-15 values of A. sulcata and B. perforatus showed an excellent linear correlation with those of the POM, a weaker correlation was found between delta N-15 of A. aerophoba and the POM, although its delta N-15 values consistently increased with the increased delta N-15 values of POM. This is attributed to the presence of different bacterial populations hosting in the sponge. A geochemical map of the delta N-15 values in the POM and organisms was created, which could be used for tracing the dispersion of N-15 loading generated by aquaculture and sewage in the receiving environment, and their transfer into biota in the adjacent coastal ecosystem. Sponges or other organisms, although known as non-selective suspension feeders, but hosting abundant bacterial populations, may have delta N-15 values lower than the POM, but still reflecting the overall enrichment of the environment in N-15 due to the presence of enriched effluents from aquaculture operation or municipal discharges.

The lake has undergone cultural eutrophication over the past 40 years and is currently eutrophic (annual averages of FRP=0.07 mg P 1-1, TP=0.11 mg P 1-1, NH4+=0.25 mg N 1-1, NO3-=0.56 mg N 1-1). FRP and NH4+ levels are correlated to external loading from streams during the winter and spring, and to internal loading during multi-day periods of summer stratification. Algal blooms occurred in summer (July-August green algae, August-September blue-green algae), autumn (October blue-green algae and diatoms), and winter (February diatoms), but not in the spring (March-June). The phytoplankton underwent brief periods of N- and P-limitation, though persistent low transparency (secchi depth of 60-80 cm) also suggests periods of light limitation. Rotifers counts were highest from mid-summer to early autumn whereas copepods were high in the spring and cladocerans were low in the summer. Removal of industrial and sewage point sources a decade ago resulted in a decrease in FRP. A phosphorus mass balance identified further reductions in external loading from the predominately agricultural catchment will decrease FRP levels further. The commercial fishery and lake hatchery also provides opportunities to control algal biomass through biomanipulation measures.

J		Article		The importance of forecasting and warning systems in implementation of integrated pest management in apple orchards in Turkey		Atlamaz, A. (aatlamaz@tagem.gov.tr) ; Zeki, C. (cevdetzeki@hotmail.com) ; Uludag, A. (ahuludag@yahoo.com)									Bulletin OEPP		2007	AUG 2007	37	2	295-299	295	299	English						Integrated Pest Management (IPM) has been widely implemented in apple orchards in various regions of Turkey. Between 1995 and 1999, in Central Anatolia and the Aegean Region, apple scab (Venturia inequalis) and codling moth (Cydia pomonella) were key pests, and implementation of pest control was based on forecasting and warning systems. During the project, orchards in which IPM was implemented and in which farmers applied conventional practices were compared. In nine provinces in which IPM projects were carried out in 1999, the damage due to codling moth was 0-1.3% in IPM orchards while it was 0.4-21.8% in nearby non-IPM orchards. It is clear that damage did not reach the acceptable threshold level of 2% in any of the IPM orchards, while damage was much higher than the threshold in conventionally-farmed orchards. The number of fungicide applications against apple scab decreased to 5-6 applications from 10-15 applications in the Egirdir district of the Isparta Province in 1996 as a result of IPM implementation. No insecticides were applied against codling moth in IPM orchards in the Nigde Province in 1998 and 1999 because population levels of the pest were low and under the economic threshold. Apple producers received training and 1200 producers from Central Anatolia became experts in IPM for their own orchards, learning to make appropriate decisions about pest control. The Apple IPM Guideline was prepared and disseminated. In Turkey modern equipment for forecasting and warning systems was employed and, in the last decade, forecasting and warning networks have been improved. Computer-based systems have increased the speed and accuracy of forecasting as well as decreasing its costs. A computerized national forecasting network in apple orchards now transmits data from the field to system headquarters automatically. The national forecasting network has been expanded and covered 12 208 800 apple trees in 34 provinces in 2006, using 115 electronic forecasting and warning stations.

Elsaesser, Martin (martin.elsaesser@lvvg.bwl.de)									Berichte ueber Landwirtschaft		2003	Dezember 2003	81	4	512-526	512	526	German	print					Decreasing amounts of roughage consumers, due to varying agricultural structures and increasing demands on forage quality of milking cows, lead to unfavourable utilization of grasses from landscape management. Extensive grazing could be a suitable alternative, whereas large pasture areas are not often existent in areas with high population density. Other alternatives for the use of grass growth from landscape management are potentially existent, but they are not yet fully developped and the support is determined by different attributes of the sites, which are not easy to solute. Alternatives are described in this article and an experiment for combustion is shown for the famous Federseerie nature reservation. It could be shown, that each processing method needs different conditions of raw material. Grasses are good suitable for the fermentation with liquid manure, but high efficient gas production needs intensively used grassland swards for successful fermentation processes. Combustion needs raw material with high lignin and drymatter contents and is therefore more suitable for organic materials from landscape management, but this locations should be urgently to mechanize and of lowest size.

In this investigation, embryotoxicity bioassays with oysters (Crassostrea gigas) were performed to assess acute toxicity of alamethicin and different groups of peptaibols produced by a Trichoderma longibrachiatum strain isolated from marine environment. C gigas embryos appeared very sensitive to all the metabolites examined with higher toxic effects for long-sequence peptides (EC50 ranging from 10 to 64nM). D-shaped larvae with mantle abnormality were particularly noticed when peptaibol concentrations increased. Disturbances of embryogenesis were also observed following exposure to organic and aqueous extract of sediments from Fier d'Ars (EC50 = 42.4 and 6.6 g L-1 dry weight, respectively). Although peptaibol concentrations measured in these sediments could explain only a part of the toxic effects observed, this study suggests that these mycotoxins can induce larval abnormalities in a population of exposed animals at environmentally realistic concentrations. Their detection in coastal areas devoted to bivalve culture should be taken into account. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Risk was associated with the usual daily volume of cold unboiled tap water drunk (odds ratio (OR) 1.40, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.14 to 1.71 per pint consumed per day (p = 0.001)) and short visits to farms (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.90, p = 0.04). Fifty-six (84%) of 67 fecal specimens from patients obtained from January 1, 1998, and February 29, 2000, were Cryptosporidium parvum genotype 2 (animal and human strain). Livestock fecal pollution of water sources appears to be the leading cause of human sporadic cryptosporidiosis in this population and shows the need for better protection of water catchments from livestock and improved drinking water treatment in this area of England.

J		Article		[The pathogenicity of Serratia plymuthica for salmonid fish]	Patogennosc Serratia plymuthica dla ryb lososiowatych	Grawinski, Edward; Antychowicz, Jerzy									Medycyna Weterynaryjna		2001		57	3	187-189	187	189	Polish	print					The purpose of the investigation was to show the presence of Serratia plymuthica in salmonid fish in Poland and to confirm the pathogenicity of Polish isolates for this fish. Since 1996 in Poland in 42 fish farms, bacteria have been isolated and identified as Serratia plymuthica from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), sea trout (Salmo trutta morpha trutta) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) with symptoms of the disease. After experimental infection the isolates of S. plymuthica appeared to be highly pathogenic for rainbow trout (8-12 g), with a density of 2X104 microorganisms (according to the scale of Mc Farland) in 0.2 ml physiologic salt solution injected intraperitoneally. On the basis of experimental infection and field observation it was proved that S. plymuthica is a serious pathogen of salmonid fish in Poland. The most numerous cases of serratiosis were observed in rainbow trout up to 12 g. The appearance of numerous cases of S. plymuthica infection in salmonid fish in Poland shows that the salmonid fish farms are endangered by serratiosis and it also provides evidence that in the aquatic environment in which the salmonid fishes are bred unfavourable ecological changes stemming among others from the growth of the organic pollution has ensued.

J	18781880	Article		Time trend of the prevalence of hepatitis e antibodies among farmers and blood donors: A potential zoonosis in Denmark		Christensen, Peer B. (peer.christensen@dadlnet.dk) ; Engle, Ronald E.; Hjort, Charlotte; Homburg, Keld M.; Vach, Werner; Georgsen, Jorgen; Purcell, Robert H.									Clinical Infectious Diseases		2008	OCT 15 2008	47	8	1026-1031	1026	1031	English						Background. Antibody to hepatitis E virus (anti-HEV) is prevalent in Western countries, where clinical hepatitis E is rarely reported. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of anti-HEV among Danish blood donors and Danish farmers. In addition, we compared the prevalence among 2 sets of serum samples obtained from blood donors 20 years apart.Methods. Samples from 291 Danish farmers and 169 blood donors that were collected in 1983 and samples from 461 blood donors that were collected in 2003 were tested for anti-HEV. Relevant information on HEV exposure was collected by self-administered questionnaire.Results. Anti-HEV testing was performed on samples after 20 years of storage at -20 degrees C. The prevalence of anti-HEV was 50.4% among farmers and 32.9% among donors in 1983 and 20.6% among donors in 2003 (P<). Presence of anti-HEV was significantly correlated with increasing age in all 3 groups (P<.05). Among donors who had serum samples obtained in 2003, age, contact with horses, and the presence of antibody to hepatitis A virus were associated with the presence of anti-HEV in multivariate analysis. Among farmers, only age was independently associated with the presence of anti-HEV.Conclusion. Anti-HEV was highly prevalent among Danes but has decreased in prevalence over the past 50 years. Our study supports the hypothesis that HEV infection in Denmark may be an asymptomatic zoonotic infection.

J	16328659	Article		Microbial community structure at different depths in disturbed and undisturbed semiarid Mediterranean forest soils		Goberna, M. (marta.goberna@uv.es) ; Insam, H.; Klammer, S.; Pascual, J. A.; Sanchez, J.									Microbial Ecology		2005	OCT 2005	50	3	315-326	315	326	English						Metabolic abilities and micrfiobial community structure were investigated through three semiarid Mediterranean soils of SE Spain. The soils were (1) a Typic Calcixerept under an adult pine plantation (PP), growing on abandoned agricultural terraces; (2) a Typic Calcixeroll under a native pinewood (NP); and (3) a Typic Haploxerept covered with a grass steppe (GS). PP and NP were similar as regards their genesis, but the former used to be tilled. NP and GS were undisturbed and supported natural and seminatural vegetation, respectively. Seven samples in 10-cm depth increments were taken in triplicate along each soil profile. Community-level physiological profiles based on sole-C-source use were determined to characterize the metabolic abilities. A 16S rDNA polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis was performed to investigate the microbial genetic structure. Plant cover and land-use history were major determinants of microbial community structure. Microbial communities residing in soils under a native pinewood, the most diverse and stable plant cover, were the most complex both metabolically and genetically. The microbial community structure distinctly changed with depth, related to the quantity and quality of total organic carbon. Both undisturbed soils showed falling gradients of metabolic and genetic complexity, which were invariably of a greater magnitude in the mature woodland than in the grass steppe. In the planted pinewood, however, the substrate-use diversity increased with depth, apparently a response to the depleted metabolic abilities within its upper layer (0-30 cm). Tilling and plant cover removal might be responsible for such a perturbation. In the same profile, molecular fingerprint patterns of the topsoil layer (0-10 cm) indicated a disturbed genetic structure that might underlie the loss of metabolic abilities. However, the genetic structure of the deeper layers of the planted and native pinewoods was not dissimilar, revealing that equivalent genetic resources perform different environmental functions under changing soil scenarios.

J		Article		Sulphur cycling in Danish agricultural soils: Inorganic sulphate dynamics and plant uptake		Eriksen, J.									Soil Biology and Biochemistry		1997		29	9-10	1379-1385	1379	1385	English						Predicting the S requirements of plants has become increasingly important in European agriculture primarily because of decreasing atmospheric S emissions. I have examined inorganic sulphate fluctuations during the year and its relation to plant uptake and S requirements. In a field study, three soil types (4, 7 and 10% clay) were mixed with carrier-free 35SO-4-S and combinations of sulphate-S and cellulose in PVC cylinders cropped with perennial rye-grass. Fertilizer S addition increased sulphate concentrations, but in a few months, they decreased again because of plant uptake, leaching and incorporation into organic matter. In the absence of cellulose, total dry matter production in rye-grass roots and tops increased up to twofold by S application, and a significant correlation was observed between soil inorganic sulphate at the start of the experiment and plant S uptake (r = 0.72). The presence of a readily available C source inhibited the uptake of both S and 35S. C addition equivalent to 10 t straw ha-1 caused immobilization and rapidly decreasing amounts of soil inorganic sulphate. Thus, plant yield, S-uptake and leaching losses were lower than in soils without C addition. During the season, the contribution of fertilizer-S to plants decreased from 46 to 26% in material sampled 84-182 d after sowing, irrespective of soil type and C addition. The decrease in the proportion of S in plants originating from fertilizer was caused by plant uptake of unlabelled soil S.	Danish Inst. Agric. Sci., Res. Cent. Foulum, P.O.

J		Article		Contribution of exotic species, environmental factors and spatial components to the macrophyte assemblages in a Mediterranean lagoon (Thau lagoon, Southern France)		Vincent, Celine; Mouillot, David; Lauret, Michel; Do Chi, Thang; Troussellier, Marc; Aliaume, Catherine (aliaume@univ-montp2.fr)									Ecological Modelling		2006	MAR 5 2006	193	1-2	119-131	119	131	English						In the Than lagoon, located on the French Mediterranean Coast, more than 20% of the macrophyte species are introduced species, likely through shellfish farming. Their impact on local soft substrate macrophyte communities has not yet been evaluated. In this study, we estimate the relationship between introduced species and the assemblage of indigenous macrophytes. Exotic species, environmental factors, and spatial distribution of macrophytes were analyzed with redundancy analysis (RDA) and partial redundancy analysis. We used data from a spatial survey that provided macrophyte densities, environmental characteristics (depth, granulometry, porosity, organic matter, phosphorous and nitrogen concentrations in the sediments), and geographical coordinates of sampling sites. The result of RDA showed that the macrophyte community structure can be explained by pure effects of exotic species (7%), pure effect of environmental factors (18%), pure spatial distribution (11%), and interactions among the above-mentioned variables (20%). Three exotic species (Dasya sessilis, Chrysymenia wrightii, and Griffithsia corallinoides) were found to have a significant effect on indigenous macrophytes distribution. C. wrightii co-occurring with Cladophora sp. and Radicilingua thysanorhizans, whereas G. corallinoides co-occurring with Cutleria multifida. Depth, porosity, total P and N and the granulometric fraction 0-2 mu m were identified as the best environmental predictors. Polysiphonia elongata and Stictyosiphon adriaticus were found in the deepest sites, whereas Nanozostera noltii was correlated with shallow waters. The distribution of Cladosiphon mediterraneus, Gracilaria bursa-pastoris, and Dictyota dichotoma depended on freshwater inputs, whilst Rytiphlaea tinctoria and Halopithys incurva were related with marine water inflows.To further investigate the relationships between species and explanatory variables, logistic regression was used expressing the presence-absence of local species with variables identified during the RDA.

J		Article		Macroalgae response to a mercury contamination gradient in a temperate coastal lagoon (Ria de Aveiro, Portugal)		Coelho, J. P. (jcoelho@dq.ua.pt) ; Pereira, M. E.; Duarte, A.; Pardal, M. A.									Estuarine Coastal and Shelf Science		2005	NOV 2005	65	3	492-500	492	500	English						Primary producers represent an important pathway for mercury incorporation in aquatic food webs. With eutrophication processes occurring worldwide, macroalgae may represent a substantial pool of mercury, as a result of its high growth rate and capacity to bind trace metals. The main aim of this work was to evaluate the response of the macroalgae to a human-induced environmental mercury gradient in a temperate coastal lagoon, by assessing the total and organic mercury contamination levels of the dominant species (Enteromorpha, Fucus and Gracilaria). Total mercury in the plant tissues ranged from 0.02 to 2.1 mu g g(-1) dwt. Fucus was the most contaminated algae, followed by Gracilaria and Enteromorpha. As a whole, organic mercury never exceeded 15% of total mercury content, but tended to increase with distance to metal source on all macroalgae indicating complex physiological responses from these primary producers in areas of high and low mercury concentrations. Sessile macroalgae may be important mercury immobilisation agents, while free-floating algae (Enteromorpha) play an important role in mercury transport from contaminated areas (+/- 10 g ha(-1)) to other areas of the lagoon and even to coastal waters. Based on the present results the use of macroalgal biomass from contaminated areas for direct or indirect human use (e.g. agricultural, industrial and food purposes) may result in health risks, due to the high bioaccumulation capacity (as high as 10(4) the dissolved mercury concentrations).

Veterinary Parasitology		2007	MAY 15 2007	146	1-2	3-8	3	8	English						The aim of the study was to determine the burden of Toxoplasma gondii-infections in sheep in Sicily, southern Italy and the risk factors for infection.Sera from 1961 sheep were collected just before slaughtering from 62 farms located in 8 out of 9 Sicilian administrative districts. The sera were analysed for Toxoplasma-specific IgG antibodies using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Sheep less than 4 weeks old were further analysed by ELISA for Toxoplasma-specific IgM-antibodies. Data on farm size and location were obtained from slaughterhouse sanitary reports and through structured telephone interviews of the veterinary officers from public health districts.The overall seroprevalence of Toxoplasma-specific IgG-antibodies were 49.9% (937/1876) by ELISA. Eighty-seven (54/62) percent of the farms had at least one Toxoplasma-positive animal. All the farms fed the animals outdoor on pasture and only one was claiming organic farming. Having cats on the farm, age of the animals, farm size and the use of surface water sources for drinking were all significantly associated with T. gondii-infected animals on the farm.T. gondii infection in mutton used for human consumption is very prevalent, and eating unprocessed sheep and lamb meat has a high risk of transmitting infections to humans. The presence of cats on the farm, farm size and using surface water as drinking water for the animals were risk factors for infection in sheep, with age as a significant confounder.

J	10966420	Article		Response of a soil bacterial community to grassland succession as monitored by 16S rRNA levels of the predominant ribotypes		Felske, Andreas; Wolterink, Arthur; Van Lis, Robert; De Vos, Willem M.; Akkermans, Antoon D. L.									Applied and Environmental Microbiology		2000	September, 2000	66	9	3998-4003	3998	4003	English	print					The composition of predominant soil bacteria during grassland succession was investigated in the Dutch Drentse A area. Five meadows, taken out of agricultural production at different time points, and one currently fertilized plot represented different stages of grassland succession. Since fertilization and agricultural production were stopped, the six plots showed a constant decline in the levels of nutrients and vegetation changes. The activity of the predominant bacteria was monitored by direct ribosome isolation from soil and temperature gradient gel electrophoresis of reverse transcription (RT)-PCR products generated from bacterial 16S rRNA. The amounts of 16S rRNA of 20 predominant ribosome types per gram of soil were monitored via multiple competitive RT-PCR in six plots at different succession stages. These ribosome types mainly represented Bacillus and members of the Acidobacterium cluster and the alpha subclass of the class Proteobacteria. The 20 16S rRNA molecules monitored represented approximately half of all bacterial soil rRNA which was estimated by dot blot hybridizations of soil rRNA with the Bacteria probe EUB338. The grasslands showed highly reproducible and specific shifts of bacterial ribosome type composition. The total bacterial ribosome level increased during the first years after agricultural production and fertilization stopped. This correlated with the collapse of the dominant Lolium perenne population and an increased rate of mineralization of organic matter. The results indicate that there is a true correlation between the total activity of the bacterial community in soil and the amount of bacterial ribosomes.

J	8727516	Article		PAH content and mutagenicity of marine sediments from the Venice lagoon		La Rocca, Cinzia; Conti, Luigi; Crebelli, Riccardo; Crochi, Barbara; Iacovella, Nicola; Rodriguez, Fabrizio; Turrio-Baldssarri, Luigi; Di Domenico, Alessandro									Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety		1996		33	3	236-245	236	245	English						Sediments from the Venice lagoon, a polluted coastal environment in northeastern Italy, were assayed for mutagenicity and content of several toxic microcontaminants, which included selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); the latter are specifically dealt with in this paper. Samples were collected at three lagoon sites with reasonably distinct environmental features-urban, industrial, or agricultural-and at two others considered to be under mixed pollution influences; a sixth sample was obtained from an open sea area to act as background control. The organic matter (EOM) associated with the mineral substrata was extracted; after cleanup, analyte determination was carried out by HRGC-LRMS(SIM) using isotopically labeled compounds as internal standards. Cumulative levels of the selected PAHs were found to be in the range of 0.065 to 0.46 mu-g/g of dry matrix at five sites; a much higher concentration (48 mu-g/g) was detected in the sample from the urban environment. The remarkable PAH level increase at this site was mostly accounted for by the concurrent, apparent increase of EOM contamination as PAH concentration was seen to reach 32 mu-g/mg of EOM from lt 1 mu-g/mg at the five remaining sites. Mutagenicity assays with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 of marine sediment organic extracts also highlighted a distinct activity in the sample from the urban site. Further fractionation and analysis of this extract pointed to PAHs as the main mutagenic component present in the sediment matrix, possibly accounting for up to approximately 70-80% of the entire mutagenic potential detected.

J		Article		Apple proliferation epidemics detected in scab-resistant apple trees		Loi, N.; Carraro, L.; Musetti, R.; Firrao, G.; Osler, R.									Journal of Phytopathology (Berlin)		1995		143	10	581-584	581	584	English						In the Friuli-Venezia Giulia, a region of Italy, where serious epidemics of apple proliferation (AP) are known to occur, varieties resistant to scab (Venturia inaequalis (Cke.) Wint.) are increasingly being used in new orchards, The most important cvs are Florina, Prima and Priscilla. These varieties were planted from 1985 to 1990 in numerous orchards which were cultivated according to organic farming regimes with no insecticides used. The results obtained in two orchards during a 7-year period of investigation indicated that the three varieties resistant to scab are highly susceptible to AP. Florina was most susceptible (high infection rate) to AP while Priscilla was most sensitive (severely affected). The identification of the disease was based on symptom expression. DAPI (4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) fluorescence technique, electron microscopy observations and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Neither complete spontaneous recovery nor death of AP-infected plants was noticed. The pattern of natural diffusion of AP does not seem to be uniform: the affected trees may be in line or grouped in certain spots of the orchards. This may indicate the activity of a not very mobile vector. It can be concluded that planting of Florina, Prima and Priscilla should be discouraged in areas where AP is a problem, particularly when organic farming regimes are being applied.	Dip. Biol. Appl.

J		Article		Seed production potential of native legumes in Iceland		Gudmundsson, Jon									Buvisindi		1997		11	0	41-48	41	48	Icelandic	print					Seed production is a necessary prerequisite for using indigenous legumes in agriculture and land reclamation. Presently, seed is only being produced from the nootka lupine, Lupinus nootkatensis, but two other species, Lathyrus japonicus and Vicia sepium, are promising candidates for large scale seed production. Other potential species are Trifolium repens, V. cracca and Anthyllis vulneraria. L. japonicus is known to set seed every year and is thus probably not dependent on insect pollination. V. sepium and L. pratense both depend on insect pollination, but it is not jet known whether the same is true for other legumes. In Iceland there are insects that can pollinate all these species apart from L. pratense of which the most productive is Bombus terrestris. Another native well-known pollen bearer is B. jonellus. Seed production of the native legumes should be concentrated in one area to ensure continuous presence of flowers throughout the summer for effective build up of pollinators. This will secure pollination of all species and increase the amount of seed. Legume seeds have a hard seed coat and must be scarified before sowing in order to give rapid germination and they must be inoculated with the appropriate Rhizobium strain.

J		Article		Risk factors for furunculosis, infectious pancreatic necrosis and mortality in post-smolt of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L		Jarp, J.; Gjevre, A. G.; Olsen, A. B.; Bruheim, T.									Journal of Fish Diseases		1995		18	1	67-78	67	78	English						An epidemiological longitudinal study comprised information obtained from 124 randomly selected Norwegian sea-sites housing post-molts of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L. Information on crude cumulative mortality, fish characteristics and farm factors was gathered by the veterinary practitioners servicing the farms. The observation period lasted from the time of sea transfer of the smolts in the spring until I October 1991. On average, 116480 smolts were transferred to each sea-site. The mean crude cumulative mortality of postsmolts during the period concerned was 16.8%. The cumulative farm-levet incidence was 54.0% for furunculosis, 39.5% for infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) and 10.5% for vibriosis. Occurrence of any of these specific infectious diseases in the post-smolt was significantly associated with mortality. The risk of furunculosis was significantly related to the location of the sea site. Mixing of smolt from many freshwater hatcheries in the sea farm increased the risk of IPN significantly. In addition, the risk of IPN was related to age of site and geographic location. The mean cumulative mortality in 1-year-old smolt groups was 17.5%, significantly greater than in two-year-old fish (7.9%). In addition, the method used to transport fish from the freshwater hatchery to the sea site was significantly associated with mortality. Neither the weight of smolts at sea transfer nor the date of transfer were significantly related to mortality.

J		Article		A morphological study of the epitheliocystis agent in farmed Atlantic salmon		Nylund, A.; Kvenseth, A. M.; Isdal, E.									Journal of Aquatic Animal Health		1998	March, 1998	10	1	43-55	43	55	English	print					During the last few years there have been several reports of epitheliocystis on farmed Atlantic salmon Salmo salar along the Norwegian coast, and heavy mortalities have been associated with the disease in some cases. Epitheliocystis has previously been described from juvenile steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss, juvenile lake trout Salvelinus namaycush, and several different nonsalmonid species. These studies of epitheliocystis suggest that the agent belongs to the order Rickettsiales or Chlamydiales. The epitheliocystis agent found in Atlantic salmon was an intracellular, gram-negative bacteria with three distinctive developmental stages: reticulate bodies (RB), intermediate bodies (IB), and elementary bodies (EB). All three stages were present within membrane-bound vacuoles in gill epithelial cells. The bodies were surrounded by two trilaminar membranes and contained ribosomes and nucleic acids. The nucleic acids in the IB and EB were condensed to a nucleoid, while the nucleic acids in the RB were found as strands of chromatin. The RB could be as long as 10 mum and could branch. The EB were coccoid with a diameter of about 0.5 mum. Based on the morphology (i.e., normal anatomy of the agent, formation and structure of altered (abnormal) forms of the agent, and features of interaction with host cells), it is suggested that the epitheliocystis agent from Atlantic salmon belongs to the order Chlamydiales.

Water Science and Technology		2002		46	11-12	177-182	177	182	English	print					The use of membrane separation technology, such as ultrafiltration (UF) and subsequent reverse osmosis (RO), for purifying different types of low-contaminated wash water of carrots (COD=1,314 mg/l) and wash water of different kinds of vegetables (COD=2,280 mg/l) was investigated on a pilot scale to determine its suitability for reuse in the process. In both membrane processes, UF and RO, the permeate flux first decreased with increasing fouling (deposition of organic and inorganic substances on the membrane surface and in its pores). After that the membrane permeability (permeate flux) and selectivity (rejection of COD) remained constant on a stable level in spite of a concentration with a volumetric concentration factor of up to 39. The tests showed that water can be obtained with a quality complying with the German regulations by applying a process combination of UF and RO. It was found that the membranes gave a 5-log reduction for total bacteria, and no coliform bacteria were present in the permeate after RO. Using UF and RO, part of the wastewater can be recovered for reuse in the process if drinking water is used for the last step of vegetable washing.

J		Article		Use of microbiotests to compare the toxicity of water samples fortified with active ingredients and formulated pesticides		Pereira, T.; Cerejeira, M. J.; Espirito-Santo, J.									Environmental Toxicology		2000	December, 2000	15	5	401-405	401	405	English	print					In Portugal rice occupies a relevant position among other irrigated crops and, since treated water is frequently discharged to the surrounding water bodies, field studies to determine the influence of pesticides used in rice treatments to aquatic biota are being performed. In order to better understand the toxicity results obtained in field conditions, particularly the influence of the pesticide formulations in the toxic effects, laboratory studies were performed using water samples fortified with the active ingredient and the respective formulated product (commercial product) of some pesticides (molinate, MCPA, propanil, endosulfan, chlorfenvinphos) usually applied in Portuguese paddies. The range of concentrations tested reflects the rates used by the farmers in real field conditions. The toxicity values observed in the laboratory during 1998 with the microbiotests Daphtoxkit magna FTM, Thamnotoxkit FTM, Artoxkit MTM, and Algaltoxkit FTM are presented and discussed in this study. The results obtained until now suggest that organic solvents and surfactants present in some of the tested formulations may affect the toxicity of the sample. In fact, water samples fortified with formulated pesticides seemed to be, in the majority of the cases, more toxic than the respective active ingredients solutions, particularly in the case of the three tested crustaceans. The microbiotests used seem to be a useful tool to evaluate toxicity with relative low cost, rapidity, and simplicity, compared with the traditional tests.	Pereira, T.; Dept.

Affected fish showed haemorrhages in the head, mouth and fins, exophthalmia and abdominal distension. The disease was also characterized by the presence of pale blue inclusions in affected erythrocytes. The examination of these erythrocytes by electron microscopy showed virus particles of 50-160 nm in size in the cytoplasm, budding at the cell membrane and extracellularly. The histopathological study revealed occasional necrosis of kidney hematopoietic tissue, an increase in the size and number of melanomacrophage centres of the spleen and kidney, and oedematous areas wit hepatocytes containing eosinophilic bodies in the liver. Degeneration of muscle fibres was accompanied by an intense inflammatory oedema. Dermatitis as well as uveitis and corneal oedema were consistent lesions.	Lamas, J.; Dep. Fundamental Biol., Fac.

J		Article		Investigation of biogeochemical activities in the soil and unsaturated zone of weathered granite		Legout, C. (cedric.legout@rennes.inra.fr) ; Molenat, J.; Lefebvre, S.; Marmonier, P.; Aquilina, L.									Biogeochemistry (Dordrecht)		2005	AUG 2005	75	2	329-350	329	350	English						This study, based on field and laboratory work, investigates the biogeochemical activity below the organic top soil horizons, particularly the potential for nitrate removal processes in the deep vadose zone (1-2.5 m depth) of a weathered granite. An experimental site located in the Kerbernez agricultural catchment (Brittany) has been equipped with ceramic cups from 0.5 to 2.5 m depth since November 2001. This arrangement allowed collection of water samples from the soil profile and the upper part of the unsaturated weathered granite. Samples were analysed twice a month for chloride, nitrate and sulphate concentrations over a period of 2.5 years. Laboratory measurements were carried out on three soil horizons and four weathered granite facies sampled in October 2003 for hydrolasic activity, potential nitrification, potential denitrification and batch experiments to study nutrient dynamics. Anion analyses in the field show that the nitrate and chloride concentrations were linearly correlated at each depth. The nitrate/chloride ratio decreased with depth in the upper part of the weathered granite from 4.93 to 2.82. This suggests that nitrate was removed during its vertical transport in the unsaturated zone. The laboratory experiments show that the bacterial activity decreased with depth. However, a significant potential for biogeochemical reactions exists below the organic soil layers. The denitrification rates obtained in the laboratory were significant, up to 800 ng N h(-1) g(-1) after about 100 h of incubation for the most reactive weathered granite facies. These rates agree with effective rates usually measured in riparian zones, but they were 50 times higher than those observed in the field. This difference suggests that the denitrification processes occurring in the field were spatially limited to localised anaerobic microsites, where the bacterial activities are controlled by the availability of N and C substrate. Finally, the laboratory measurements lead us to assume that heterotrophic denitrification was clearly the predominant process occurring in the field because of the good correlation between nitrate concentration variation and carbon content (r = -0.94). Moreover, the slight increase in sulphate concentrations observed in the field and in the laboratory was insufficient to explain the complete removal of nitrate.

J		Article		Micropalaeontological record of Holocene estuarine and marine stages in the Corgo do Porto rivulet (Mira River, SW Portugal)		Alday, Maria (gpbalbem@lg.ehu.es) ; Cearreta, Alejandro; Cachao, Mario; Freitas, M. Conceicao; Andrade, Cesar; Gama, Cristina									Estuarine Coastal and Shelf Science		2006	FEB 2006	66	3-4	532-543	532	543	English						The Corgo do Porto is a small tributary of the Mira River, outleting 3.5 km upstream of its mouth. The valley is flat-floored due to terrigenous siltation and forms an alluvial plain reclaimed for agriculture/aquaculture. These conditions were quite distinct in the recent past because of extensive marine flooding of this area during the high-rate positive eustatism that followed the Last Glacial Maximum. The Holocene sedimentary column registers changes imposed by several forcing factors, mainly the climate-driven sea-level rise. As part of a multidisciplinary study, the sedimentological and micropalaeontological (benthic foraminifera and calcareous nannofossils) contents of a core taken from this infill were analyzed, and five different stages were distinguished within its environmental evolution: Stage A (prior to 10,000 cal yrs BP) consists of muddy, matrix-supported sand with abundant pebbles, barren of microfossils, and free of carbonates and organic matter that represents a fluvial environment contemporaneous of a low sea level. Between 10,000 and circa 4000 cal yrs BP the sediment is made of homogeneous mud, with bioclasts and organic matter. However, the assemblages of foraminifera and calcareous nannoplankton allowed the identification of several environmental stages, defining a cycle of increasing-decreasing marine influence inside the valley: brackish and brackish-marine sedimentation (Stage B), full-marine sedimentation (Stage C) and a return to brackish-marine sedimentation (Stage D). The final part of the core is barren of microfossils (Stage E) and it represents the modern sedimentation in the area with an accreting alluvial plain. This Holocene sedimentary sequence reflects an evolutionary succession that closely agrees with the palaeoenvironmental model previously presented by the authors elsewhere for the south-western Portuguese coast, where a change in the rate of sea-level rise has been recorded at around 5500 cal yrs BP when a very effective sandy barrier formed and isolated restricted brackish to fresh-water lagoonal environments from the open sea.

J		Article		The Inter-genebank Potato Database and the dimensions of available wild potato germplasm		Huaman, Z.; Hoekstra, R.; Bamberg, J. B.									American Journal of Potato Research		2000	November-December, 2000	77	6	353-362	353	362	English	print					The Association of Potato Inter-genebank Collaborators (APIC) constructed a database of all wild potato holdings of the most important potato genebanks in Europe, the United States, Peru, and Argentina. The Inter-genebank Potato Database (IPD) now contains data of 11,819 wild potato accessions conserved in seven potato genebanks. The collector's number is the key identifier used to merge all databases into the IPD. A total of 7,112 different wild potato accessions were identified, which comprise 5,306 accessions with known collector's numbers. The IPD passport database showed that almost 30% of accessions held in APIC genebanks are from Argentina, a country that comprises less species diversity than Peru and Bolivia. These latter countries are represented by 24% and 20% of accessions, respectively. APIC genebanks maintain 188 Solanum taxa out of more than 230 recognized by the latest comprehensive treatment of potatoes (Solanum sect. Petota) by Hawkes (1990). About 60% of the accessions comprise only 20 taxa represented by 785 to 92 accessions each. Conversely, 2% of the accessions comprise 72 taxa and are represented by five or fewer accessions each. About 70 taxa are not available in any genebank. The IPD evaluation database comprises 5,603 records with data from more than 33,000 evaluations of wild potato accessions. Fifty-five traits are summarized, including the reactions of the accessions to 12 pathotypes or races or strains of 12 fungi, four bacteria, 12 viruses, one viroid, 13 nematodes, and seven insects; response to heat and cold stress; and content of dry matter, starch, vitamin C, amylase, reducing sugars, and glycoalkaloids. About 30% of the wild potato populations screened showed various levels of resistance to most of the diseases and pests evaluated. The IPD database is available on the Internet at www.potgenebank.org.	Huaman, Z.; International Potato Center (CIP), Av.

J		Article		An assessment of recent environmental change in Llangorse Lake using palaeolimnology		Bennion, Helen; Appleby, Peter									Aquatic Conservation		1999	July-Aug., 1999	9	4	361-375	361	375	English	print					1. The diatom record preserved in a sediment core from Llangorse Lake in South Wales, a site of national and international conservation importance, was analysed to evaluate the post-1850 nutrient history of the lake. Fossil diatom assemblages were analysed in 13 samples of a dated sediment core from the easterly lake basin. 2. A diatom-based transfer function was applied to the fossil diatom data to generate a quantitative reconstruction of in-lake total phosphorus (TP) concentrations, following taxonomic harmonization between the training set and core species data. The TP reconstruction was calculated using a north-west European calibration set of 152 lakes. 3. The diatom assemblages were dominated by non-planktonic taxa, in particular Fragilaria spp. until ca 1950, since which time there has been a switch to domination by planktonic diatoms. This switch is most likely a response to reduced light conditions and the decline in submerged macrophytes in the lake, brought about by nutrient enrichment perhaps coupled with enhanced inwash of soils, and thus a loss of habitats for epiphytic and benthic taxa. The exact causes of enrichment remain unclear and are currently under investigation, although increased use of fertilizers, agricultural intensification, afforestation and development of tourism and recreation have all been suggested as possible factors. The recent (post-1985) diatom assemblages are associated with mesotrophic conditions and indicate some degree of lake recovery. 4. Application of the transfer function showed that Llangorse Lake has experienced a decline in TP concentrations since the mid-1980s, following at least a century of high and stable TP levels of ca 150 mug TP L-1. The timing of this decrease appears to be related to the sewage diversion in 1981 and a further smaller diversion in 1992. Future monitoring of the lake is recommended in order to observe whether the improvement in water quality is maintained or indeed enhanced.

J	9820579	Article		Validation of a monoclonal antibody-based ELISA to detect antibodies directed against swine vesicular disease virus		Chenard, G.; Bloemraad, M.; Kramps, J. A.; Terpstra, C.; Dekker, A.									Journal of Virological Methods		1998	Nov., 1998	75	1	105-112	105	112	English	print					A simple, rapid and sensitive competitive monoclonal antibody-based ELISA for the detection of antibodies directed against swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV) was developed. The ELISA was validated using field sera originating from SVDV-infected and non-infected Dutch pig herds, reference sera obtained from the Community Reference Laboratory for Swine Vesicular Disease at the Institute for Animal Health, Pirbright Laboratory, UK, and sera from animals infected experimentally. When testing 4277 sera originating from non-infected Dutch pig herds and collected as part of the national screening program, this ELISA had only 0.6% false positive results, whereas apprxeq 2% of false positive results were obtained with a conventional blocking ELISA used until recently. A sensitivity relative to the virus neutralisation test of > 97% was achieved when testing sera collected from Dutch pig farms where an outbreak of SVDV had occurred. All international reference sera scored consistently correct. Sera collected sequentially from pigs experimentally infected with SVDV isolates representing all currently recognized antigenic groups, were scored positive slightly earlier by the ELISA compared to the virus neutralisation test. This monoclonal antibody-based competitive ELISA for SVDV antibodies designated the Ceditest ELISA for SVDV-Ab, is as sensitive but more specific than the ELISA used until recently. Because sera are tested at a single dilution (1:5), incubations are carried out at room temperature and test results are available within 3 h, this ELISA is simple, easy to automate and therefore very suitable for screening large numbers of serum samples.

J	17517722	Article		Risk factors for changing test classification in the Danish surveillance program for Salmonella in dairy herds		Nielsen, L. R. (lrn@life.ku.dk) ; Warnick, L. D.; Greiner, M.									Journal of Dairy Science		2007	JUN 2007	90	6	2815-2825	2815	2825	English						A surveillance program in which all cattle herds in Denmark are classified into Salmonella infection categories has been in place since 2002. Dairy herds were considered test negative and thus most likely free of infection if Salmonella antibody measurements were consistently low in bulk tank milk samples collected every 3 mo. Herds were considered test positive and thus most likely infected if the 4-quarter moving average bulk tank milk antibody concentration was high or if there was a large increase in the most recent measurement compared with the average value from the previous 3 samples. The objective of this study was to evaluate risk factors for changing from test negative to positive, which was indicative of herds becoming infected from one quarter of the year to the next, and risk factors for changing from test positive to negative, which was indicative of herds recovering from infection between 2 consecutive quarters of the year. The Salmonella serotypes in question were Salmonella Dublin or other serotypes that cross-react with the Salmonella Dublin antigen in the ELISA (e.g., some Salmonella Typhimurium types). Two logistic regression models that accounted for repeated measurements at the herd level and controlled for herd size and regional effects were used. Data from 2003 was used for the analyses. A change from test negative to positive occurred in 2.0% of the quarterly observations (n = 21,007) from test negative dairy herds. A change from test positive to negative occurred in 10.0% of quarterly observations ( n = 6,168) available from test positive dairy herds. The higher the number of test-positive neighbor herds in the previous year-quarter, the more likely herds were to become test positive for Salmonella. The number of purchased cattle from test-positive herds was also associated with changing from test negative to positive. The bigger the herd, the more likely it was to change from negative to test positive. The effect of herd size on recovery was less clear. Large herds consisting mainly of large breeds or having test-positive neighbors in a 2-km radius were less likely to change from test positive to negative, whereas the breed and neighbor factors were not found to be important for small herds. Organic production was associated with remaining test positive, but not with becoming test positive. The results emphasize the importance of external and internal biosecurity measures to control Salmonella infections.	Nielsen, L.

Mammalia		1995		59	4	629-637	629	637	English						British Government policy on wildlife rabies control has always concentrated exclusively on poison baiting of foxes. This approach has been followed, because unlike continental countries, a rabies outbreak would originate from a focal point of infection. Given the level of success of rabies vaccination on the European continent, it is time to evaluate the possible inclusion of vaccines into rabies control in the U.K. This paper details the recent development of MAFF's Rabies Model to include vaccination and revised fox contact data. A number of different strategies are examined by this new model, including poisoning, vaccination, and poisoning combined with a ring of vaccination. The results of each strategy are presented, and discussed in terms of rabies control in the U.K.	Central Sci.

Thorax		2004	May 1, 2004	59	5	381-386	381	386	English	print					Background: A protective effect of endotoxin exposure on atopy and asthma in farmers' children has been postulated. Studies of adult farmers have shown conflicting results but often lack exposure data. The prevalence of asthma in farmers with different exposure levels to microbial agents and irritant gases was compared. Methods: Atopy was defined as a positive response to multiple radioallergosorbent tests (RAST) with a panel of 10 common respiratory allergens, and asthma was ascertained by a questionnaire using a stratified sample (n = 2169) of a farming population from south-eastern Norway. Exposure of farmers to total dust, fungal spores, bacteria, endotoxins, and ammonia was assessed by exposure measurements. Results: The prevalence of asthma was 3.7% for physician diagnosed asthma and 2.7% for current asthma. The prevalence of atopy was 14%, but most asthmatic subjects were non-atopic (80%). Compared with farmers without livestock, ( 1) asthma was significantly higher in cattle farmers (ORadj 1.8, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.8) and pig farmers (ORadj 1.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.5), (2) non-atopic asthma was significantly higher in pig farmers (ORadj 2.0, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.3) and in farmers with two or more types of livestock (ORadj 1.9, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.3), and ( 3) atopic asthma was less common in farmers with two or more types of livestock (ORadj 0.32, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.97). Exposure to endotoxins, fungal spores, and ammonia was positively associated with non-atopic asthma and negatively associated with atopic asthma. No associations were found with atopy. Conclusions: Exposure to endotoxins and fungal spores appears to have a protective effect on atopic asthma but may induce non-atopic asthma in farmers.

International Dairy Journal		2005	JUN-SEP 2005	15	6-9	605-617	605	617	English						Piacentinu is a traditional Sicilian ewes' milk cheese produced in the province of Enna. The objective of this study was to determine whether altering the traditional conditions under which Piacentinu cheeses are made affects their volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and sensory characteristics. Cheeses were obtained from different farms and ripened for 2 to 6 months. Those made from raw milk and artisanal rennets contained a more diverse group of VOCs, especially with respect to terpenes, and had significantly stronger aroma intensities in most categories except fruity. Cheeses made from pasteurised milk with commercial starters and rennets had significantly stronger salty and spicy tastes.

ALEX Study Grp								Allergy (Oxford)		2005	February 2005	60	2	177-184	177	184	English	print					Background: An increasing number of studies report pet exposure to be associated with lower risk of asthma and allergies. This 'protective pet effect' has been suggested to result from a modified T-helper (Th)2-cell response, or because of increased microbial load in homes where pets are kept. We examined the associations between pet contact and the occurrence of asthma and allergies in children of the rural Allergy and Endotoxin (ALEX) population, taking farm animal contact, endotoxin and cat allergen levels in mattress dust into account. Methods: Information about contact with pets and farm animals, asthma and allergy were collected for 812 children by a standardized parents' questionnaire and an interview. Mattress dust endotoxin and cat allergen levels as well as specific IgE and IgG4 antibodies to Fel d1 were determined. Results: Current contact with dogs was inversely associated with diagnosed hay fever (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.11-0.57), diagnosed asthma (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.12-0.71), sensitization to cat allergen (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.23-0.99) and to grass pollen (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.33-0.94), but not with increased IgG4 levels. Early and current contact with cats were associated with reduced risk of wheezing (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.23-1.00, and OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.26-0.92, respectively) and grass pollen sensitization. Adjustment for farm animal contact but not for endotoxin and cat allergen exposure attenuated these associations and the effect of pet was stronger among farmers' children. Conclusion: Although pet exposure was very frequent in this rural population, the inverse relation between current dog contact, asthma and allergy was mostly explained by simultaneously occurring exposure to stable animals or was restricted to farm children. In addition, a subtle form of pet avoidance may contribute to the protective effect of pet.

J		Article		Relative importance of burning, mowing and species translocation in the restoration of a former boreal hayfield: responses of plant diversity and the microbial community		Antonsen, Hilde (hilde.antonsen@umb.no) ; Olsson, Pal Axel									Journal of Applied Ecology		2005	APR 2005	42	2	337-347	337	347	English						1. The extensive loss of species-rich grasslands in Europe as a result of agricultural intensification has triggered a desire to recreate more diverse and natural grassland systems in set-aside fields. Appropriate management and species introductions are necessary to overcome residual soil fertility, lack of suitable plant propagules and dominance of undesirable invasive species.2. A field experiment was performed in a boreal former hayfield to test the effect of turf inoculation, mowing (twice annually) and spring burning. We surveyed changes in plant diversity, composition and productivity over a 3-year period. Signature fatty acids and soil respiration measurements were employed to survey changes in the soil community.3. Few changes in the vegetation and soil communities could be related to inoculation of turf monoliths. Most of the measured variables in mown plots differed from the set-aside (control) plots, while burned plots displayed mainly similar responses. Mowing increased plant species richness and diversity, mainly by enhancing the number and frequency of forb species. Small-statured forb species were promoted by mowing, whereas tall leafy grasses declined. Effects of mowing on soil communities comprised an increased soil respiration and stimulation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.4. Synthesis and applications. The results demonstrate the importance of reducing sward height in order to promote plant species coexistence in former boreal hayfields. In such systems, eliminating accumulated litter by spring burning has little influence on species composition when the sward is allowed to grow tall. Mowing is therefore the most efficient way of enhancing biodiversity. The results also show that mowing-mediated changes in above-ground plant communities may stimulate below-ground symbiotic micro-organisms, potentially resulting in a positive feedback on ecosystem development.

The present knowledge of diseases is limited from a practical point of view. A number of diseases and parasites have been identified, for some therapeutical treatments are described, for a few diseases the biochemical action is known but for most of the diseases and parasites the ways they are spread is very poorly understood. These gaps in our knowledge hampers the management of wild as well as farmed crayfish populations.	Dep. Systems Ecology, Sect.

Swine and human HEV strains are genetically related suggesting both a zoonotic and a possible foodborne transmission. The prevalence of swine HEV was investigated in 274 randomly selected pigs from six different swine farms of Northern Italy, testing viral RNA in stools by nested reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction. HEV genome was detected in 115 stools (42%). All farms resulted positive for HEV, with a prevalence ranging between 12.8% and 72.5%. HEV-positive pigs were detected in all age groups and production stages tested, although infection was more prevalent in weaners than in the older fatteners (42.2% vs. 27.0%). Genetic characterization of swine strains identified was performed by sequencing and database alignment. Phylogenetic analysis on the nucleotide sequences from 16 positive PCR products indicated that all strains belonged to genotype 3. In particular, one group of seven Italian strains clustered close (91.6-96.2% identity) to human and swine European HEV strains. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J		Article	Literature Review	New results in the research of fish parasitic myxosporeans. Literature review and own experiences	Ujabb eredmenyek a halparazita nyalkasporasfajok kutatasaban - Irodalmi attekintes es sajat tapasztalatok	Racz Orsolya Zita (racz@vmri.hu)									Magyar Allatorvosok Lapja		2005	APR 2005	127	4	213-222	213	222	Hungarian						Research on myxosporeans is one of the most dynamically developing fields of fish parasitology. The results achieved in recent years prompted the author to write an overview, which is a continuation of relating papers published in this journal earlier, including a review in 1999 on the life cycles of myxosporeans, and another paper on molecular studies in 2002. In recent years, the Hungarian fish pathological research group achieved results in the following fields: (1) New myxosporean species have been described in Hungary, such as Myxobolus margitae from the gills of bleak and M. intrachondrealis from the cartilage of the gill arches of one- and two-summer-old common carp. (2) In addition to the new species, several myxosporean species previously recorded only in other parts of the world were detected in Hungary for the first time, such as M. diversus Nie et Li, 1973, a parasite of the fins of goldfish or M. cyprinkola Reuss, 1906 infecting the gut of common carp. (3) Recently, actinosporean stages of three Myxobolus species (M. bramae, M. pseudodispar and M. macrocapsulari) have been detected from their experimentally infected oligochaete alternate hosts. Triactinomyxon-type actinospores were detected in each case. (4) In the case of the species M. pseudodispar, the complete developmental cycle could be reproduced, i.e. laboratory-cultured SPF fish were successfully infected with experimentally obtained actinospores. (5) In addition to studying the actinosporean infection of oligochaetes collected from Hungarian fish farms and natural waters, actinospores have been detected from oligochaetes collected in Japanese, Spanish and Estonian biotopes, in many cases for the first time in the given country. (6) The importance of localisation within the fish host and tissue specificity, as a phenotypic characteristic important in addition to spore morphology, has been highlighted in connection with the development of some myxosporeans infecting the fins of fish in Hungary. (7) in the framework of molecular studies on myxosporeans, studies on the structure of 18S rRNA gene of some Myxobolus spp. infecting the muscles of fish proved that the new parasite species had developed through parallel evolution with the fish hosts.

Water Science and Technology		2001		44	11-12	523-530	523	530	English	print					A study was conducted between December 1997 and December 1998 in NE Italy on a 3,200 m2 surface flow vegetated wetland receiving agricultural drainage water from a cultivated field of about 6 ha and occasional applications of organic wastes. The study aimed at evaluating: 1) biomass and seasonal nitrogen dynamics in above- and below-ground biomass of Phragmites australis Cav. (Trin.) and Typha latifolia (L.) grown in separate zones; 2) the effectiveness of the wetland in removing nutrients and sediments coming from the fields; 3) the possibility that wetland could treat occasional applications of organic wastes and 4) to collect some general information on whether the wetland can receive heavy loads coming from storm water runoff. Monthly observations showed that, in both species, aboveground biomass, nitrogen concentration and nitrogen content reached maximum values in summer and minimum values in winter. The contrary occurred in below-ground biomass. The total input of water in the wetland was 66,000 m3 ha-1, of which 7,700 were drained. Total nitrogen input was 526 kg ha-1, of which 58 were discharged out of the wetland.

J		Article		A simple model for estimation of atmospherically-derived nitrogen in grass-clover systems		Kristensen, Erik Steen; Hogh-Jensen, Henning; Kristensen, Ib Sillebak									Biological Agriculture and Horticulture		1995		12	3	263-276	263	276	English						Atmospherically-derived nitrogen can be a major source of nitrogen in organic or other low-input farming systems. It is, however, in practice difficult to quantify the contribution of nitrogen from the atmosphere especially when dealing with grass-clover leys in the crop rotation. In this study a simple model based on knowledge about the content of clover in herbage and the time after establishment is presented and calibrated to a range of production conditions in Denmark. A statistical analysis of three experiments showed that the content of clover made a satisfactory description of the variation in atmospherically-derived nitrogen above stubble height (harvested fixed-N-2). The variation in harvested fixed-N-2 was considerable (38-208 kg N ha-1 year-1) due to experimental manipulation by rate of N-fertilizer, cutting frequency, soil type and irrigation. It was, however, also found that the time after establishment of the grass-clover leys has a significant effect in that way, that at a given content of clover harvested fixed-N-2 in the 3rd, 4th and 5th cropping year was only 2/3 of that in the 1st and 2nd cropping year. Mineralization and immobilization of nitrogen are discussed to predict accumulation of atmospherically-derived nitrogen below stubble height. It is concluded that within the first two years after establishment there is a net accumulation of fixed-N-2 below stubble height corresponding to 24-29% of harvested fixed-N-2. After the 2nd year the total fixed-N-2 is assumed to correspond directly to harvested fixed-N-2. based on three classes of visual estimates of clover content (10-29%, 30-49% or above 49%), the atmospherically-derived nitrogen was estimated to be (kg ha-1 year-1) 80, 157 or 248 in the first two years and 47, 84 or 128 in the 3rd, 4th and 5th years.

J		Article		Potato virus Y reduction by straw mulch in organic potatoes		Saucke, H.; Doering, T. F. (doringt@wiz.uni-kassel.de)									Annals of Applied Biology		2004		144	3	347-355	347	355	English	print					Potato virus Y (PVY) is transmitted non-persistently by winged morphs of many aphid species and is a major problem in seed potato production. In order to evaluate the potential of straw mulch applications (4-5 t ha-1) and presprouting on PVY reduction, small scale organically managed field experiments were carried out in Northern Hessen, Germany, over 3 yr. In all years mulching significantly reduced aphid infestation on leaves as well as PVY incidence in tubers. For the effect of presprouting the temporal coincidence of two factors was crucial - crop emergence and aphid flight activity. Presprouting decreased PVY incidence when in the phase of early crop emergence aphid spring flight activity was low, but increased it, although not significantly, when prominent aphid flight peaks occurred in this critical period. Straw mulch was most effective when vector pressure was concentrated early in the year acting as a PVY protectant for young plants. In later growth stages its effect declined gradually with increasing ground coverage of the crop. Combined mulching and presprouting had a synergistic, complementary effect on reduction of PVY incidence. In an on-farm experiment in 2001 scaling up the area mulched stepwise from 100 m2 to 900 m2 Consistently kept aphid infestation at reduced levels.	Doering, T.

Characteristics of 53 atypical A. salmonicida strains originating from Finland, Denmark, Norway and Sweden were studied using 60 phenotypic tests. Ribopattern analysis and plasmid profiles were used as genetic methods. The production of brown pigment on the furunculosis agar containing L-tyrosine divided the atypical oxidase-positive strains into two groups: pigment-producing (n = 35) and achromogenic (n = 16). PstI differentiated all the atypical A. salmonicida from A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida. Combined ribopatterns ClaI/PstI divided pigment producing atypical strains into four major groups B/B, G/G, G/T, F/F. Most of the achromogenic oxidase-positive strains belonged to two major groups H/H or U/U. Cluster analysis of ribopatterns and plasmid profile analysis also supported the division of atypical oxidase-positive A. salmonicida into pigment-producing and achromogenic groups. The oxidase-negative strains formed a distinct group which differed from oxidase-positive atypical A. salmonicida type biochemically and in terms of ribopatterns. Our results also support the use of ribopattern analysis as a valid method to study the epidemiology of infections caused by atypical A. salmonicida on fish farms.	Hanninen, Marja-Liisa; Dep.

Journal of Fish Diseases		1992		15	5	393-400	393	400	English						Bath treatments with mebendazole (MBZ) are commonly used for control of pseudodactylogyrosis in intensive eel culture systems in Europe. To assess the potential for selection of drug-resistant gill parasites in these systems, the authors have conducted a number of sub-therapeutic treatments of an anthelmintic naive population of Pseudodactylogyrus bini (Kikuchi, 1929) Gussev, 1965, and P. anguillae (Yin et Sproson, 1948) Gussev, 1965, with different concentrations of MBZ. Parasite populations subtherapeutically treated seven times during a 7-month period with 0.05 and 0.005 mg MBZ l-1 developed a high and low relative resistance to MBZ, respectively. It was shown that low temperatures decreased the effect of MBZ. In addition, the benzimidazoles albendazole and triclabendazole produced a comparatively lower parasiticidal effect, and it is suggested that treatments at low temperatures or with low effect benzimidazoles will increase the risk of selection of drug-resistant gill parasites in eel farms.

J		Article		Hypolimnetic eutrophication of the N-limited dimictic L. Esrom 1908-1998. Pelagic-benthic coupling effects between phytoplankton and profundal zoobenthos, its growth, respiration and survival.		Jonasson, Petur M.									Archiv fuer Hydrobiologie Supplement		2003	November 2003	139	4	449-512	449	512	English	print					Anthropogenic influences on natural lakes were modest until the 20th century. Seriously increased inputs of N and P from agriculture, sewage and precipitation have fertilized lakes. The consequence, in the epilimnion of dimictic lakes, has been a high production of phytoplankton shading the macrophytic vegetation and turning the bottom into a barren sediment. In the hypolimnion, increased sedimentation of organic matter reduced the oxygen content with inferred serious limitation on animal life. The pelagic-benthic coupling aspects of these changes are discussed in terms of increased nutrient input, increased primary phytoplankton production and sedimentation, reduced species diversity in the profundal, metabolic and respiratory adaptations together with changes in feeding, growth, survival, life histories, voltinism, and community structure of profundal zoobenthos.

A.; Hazel, S.; Kemp, R.; Leatherbarrow, A. J. H.; Moore, A.; Sutherst, J.; Turner, J.; Williams, N. J.; Wright, E. J.; French, N. P.									Applied and Environmental Microbiology		2004	November 2004	70	11	6501-6511	6501	6511	English	print					Humans are exposed to Campylobacter spp. in a range of sources via both food and environmental pathways. For this study, we explored the frequency and distribution of thermophilic Campylobacter spp. in a 10- by 10-km square rural area of Cheshire, United Kingdom. The area contains approximately 70, mainly dairy, farms and is used extensively for outdoor recreational activities. Campylobacter spp. were isolated from a range of environmental samples by use of a systematic sampling grid. Livestock (mainly cattle) and wildlife feces and environmental water and soil samples were cultured, and isolates were presumptively identified by standard techniques. These isolates were further characterized by PCR. Campylobacter jejuni was the most prevalent species in all animal samples, ranging from 11% in samples from nonavian wildlife to 36% in cattle feces, and was isolated from 15% of water samples. Campylobacter coli was commonly found in water (17%) and sheep (21%) samples, but rarely in other samples. Campylobacter lari was recovered from all sample types, with the exception of sheep feces, and was found in moderate numbers in birds (7%) and water (5%). Campylobacter hyointestinalis was only recovered from cattle (7%) and birds (1%). The spatial distribution and determinants of C. jejuni in cattle feces were examined by the use of model-based spatial statistics. The distribution was consistent with very localized within-farm or within-field transmission and showed little evidence of any larger-scale spatial dependence. We concluded that there is a potentially high risk of human exposure to Campylobacter spp., particularly C. jejuni, in the environment of our study area. The prevalence and likely risk posed by C. jejuni-positive cattle feces in the environment diminished as the fecal material aged. After we took into account the age of the fecal material, the absence or presence of rain, and the presence of bird feces, there was evidence of significant variation in the prevalence of C. jejuni-positive cattle feces between grazing fields but no evidence of spatial clustering beyond this resolution. The spatial pattern of C. jejuni is therefore consistent with that for an organism that is ubiquitous in areas contaminated with cattle feces, with a short-scale variation in infection intensity that cannot be explained solely by variations in the age of the fecal material. The observed pattern is not consistent with large-scale transmission attributable to watercourses, wildlife territories, or other geographical features that transcend field and farm boundaries.

J	10746236	Article		Incidence of occupational diseases in Poland		Szeszenia-Dabrowska, Neonila; Szymczak, Wieslaw									Medycyna Pracy		1999		50	6	479-496	479	496	Polish	print					The paper is aimed at presenting the incidence of occupational diseases in Poland. The analysis was performed on the basis of the information included in 'occupational disease certificates'. All sanitary and epidemiological stations throughout the country are committed to send these certificates to the Central Register of Occupational Medicine in The Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine in Lodz. The incidence of occupational diseases during the three recent years (1996-97-98) was the subject of a thorough analysis. In all, 11 318, 11 685 and 12 017 cases of occupational diseases, respectively were registered over those three years. The corresponding rates were 116.0, 116.9 and 117.3, respectively per 100 000 people employed. In 1998, diseases of the voice organ predominated (30.4%) of all occupational diseases) and they were followed by hearing impairment (28.2%), infectious and parasitic diseases (9.9%), pneumoconioses (8.2%), dermatoses (6.4%), vibratory syndrome (2.9%) and poisoning (2.5%). These disease categories constituted over 88% of all occupational diseases registered in that year. Diseases of the voice organ which showed the greatest growth dynamic were mainly diagnosed among teachers. Neither in the United States nor in the member states of the European Union, this pathology is included into the list of occupational diseases. In view of high rates of its incidence in our country it has become one of essential problems of occupational medicine. In Poland, particular attention is paid to infectious and parasitic diseases among which hepatitis occupies the first place (65%), mostly among health service workers. The decrease in hepatitis incidence observed in the 1990s has been due to an intensive vaccination programme in this group of workers. The incidence of occupational hepatitis became rather stable and accounted for 940 cases per year, however the incidence of hepatitic C increased at the same time. Lower rates of incidence of 'classic' occupational diseases, such as poisoning, pneumoconioses or vibratory syndrome are a positive observation. It is also interesting to note that the rate of occupational diseases diagnosed in advanced stage has also diminished. When analysing occupational diseases one should bear in mind that the majority of pathologies already diagnosed result from long-term effect of exposure to harmful factors. In all, 93% of cases of occupational diseases emerged after a ten-year exposure. The highest rates, taking account of sections of activity, were found in mining and quarrying, health service, agriculture, hunting and forestry.	Szeszenia-Dabrowska, Neonila; Szymczak, Wieslaw; Sw.

J		Article		Relationship between land-use in the agro-forestry system of les Landes, nitrogen loading to and risk of macro-algal blooming in the Bassin d'Arcachon coastal lagoon (SW France)		de Wit, R. (rde-wit@univ-montp2.fr) ; Leibreich, R.; Vernier, F.; Delmas, F.; Beuffe, H.; Maison, Ph.; Chossat, J. -C.; Laplace-Treyture, C.; Laplana, R.; Clave, V.; Torre, M.; Auby, I.; Trut, G.; Maurer, D.; Capdeville, P.									Estuarine Coastal and Shelf Science		2005	February 2005	62	3	453-465	453	465	English	print					Nitrogen loading to the Bassin d'Arcachon coastal lagoon (SW France) was evaluated by studying land-use and nitrogen output in its 3001 km2 catchment. At present, the catchment is dominated by forestry (79%), while intensive agriculture occupies 9% of the surface. The N-output of two hydrological subunits, i.e. the Tagon subunit dominated by pine forestry and the Arriou 11 subunit comprising both forestry and intensive agriculture, were monitored for a seven year period (1996-2002). From these observations it was calculated that forestry contributes on average 1.6 kg total N ha-1 yr-1, which is dominated by organic nitrogen (DON+PON are 70% of N). On an areal basis, intensive agriculture contributes 26 times more than forestry, i.e. 41.6 kg total N ha-1 yr-1, which is mainly in the form of nitrate (65% of N). These data were upscaled to the catchment and the upscaling was validated by comparison to gauged nitrogen throughputs for the catchment of the Leyre river that is the major tributary to the system. Taking into account the other known N sources and the interannual variability in the catchment it was estimated that nitrogen loading to the lagoon was on average 90 kg ha-1 yr-1 (range from 54 to 126 kg ha-1 yr-1). The sandy soils of the catchment have a clear potential for denitrification, but anoxic conditions (waterlogged) and input of organic matter to fuel this process are required. Currently, agricultural practices and spatial planning do not make use of this potential. Nitrogen loading in the Bassin d'Arcachon is reflected by 10-40 muM nitrate concentrations in winter, which became depleted during spring as a result of uptake by vegetation. Short-term uptake experiments showed that the macroalga Monostroma obscurum is well adapted to temperatures between 10 to 20degreeC and competitive with respect to the seagrass Zostera noltii when the nitrate concentrations are above 10 muM. Spring conditions with high nitrate and high insolation are therefore favourable for M. obscurum and this species presents a high risk for algal blooming. In contrast, the macroalga Enteromorpha clathrata well adapted to summertime temperatures around 25degreeC, forms occasionally blooms in the lagoon. This phenomenon is limited due to the low DIN concentrations in summer. Copyright 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Virus-neutralisation (VN) with the TBEV strain Hypr and CV-1 cells was used in TBE tests, and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) with neutrophils from goats experimentally infected with A. phagocytophilum was used for TBF testing. In 13 sheep from the incriminated herd (N = 41), VN titres ranging from 1/4 to 1/128 traced previous TBE infection and all sheep had elevated titres of A. phagocytophilum antibodies ranging from 1/80 to 1/5120 in IFA, whereas two other herds (N = 8 and 9) were seronegative for TBEV and had significantly lower levels of A. phagocytophilum antibodies, corresponding to a lesser challenge from TBF. A control herd (N = 10) that was grazed on tick-free meadows in north Norway was completely seronegative. The respective distributions of positive titres of A. phagocytophilum and TBEV antibodies in the incriminated herd were not mutually random; the animals with higher anti-A. phagocytophilum titres tended to have lower anti-TBEV titres and vice versa (Spearman correlation coeff. = -0.86, p ltoreq 0.01). The authors hypothesize that the immunosuppressive effect of TBF co-infection in sheep could be a contributory cause of TBE-virus contamination of milk, an aspect of TBE epidemiology that has not been considered thus far.

J	9169904	Article	Literature Review	Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE): Causes and consequences of a common source epidemic		Nathanson, Neal; Wilesmith, John; Griot, Christian									American Journal of Epidemiology		1997		145	11	959-969	959	969	English						Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) or prion disease of cattle first recognized in 1986 in the United Kingdom, where it produced a common source epidemic that peaked in January 1993 and has subsided markedly since that time. The epidemic began simultaneously at many geographic locations and was traced to contamination of meat and bone meal (MBM), a dietary supplement prepared from rendering of slaughterhouse offal. It appears that the epidemic was initiated by the presence of the agent of scrapie (a long-standing TSE of sheep) that was first transmitted to cattle, beginning in the early 1980s, when most rendering plants abandoned the use of organic solvents in the preparation of MBM. The epidemic was probably accelerated by the recycling of infected bovine tissues prior to the recognition of BSE. To terminate the epidemic, a prohibition on the feeding of ruminant-derived protein to ruminants was introduced in the United Kingdom in July 1988. The ruminant feed ban accounts for the decline of the epidemic after an interval of about 5 years, approximately equivalent to the average incubation period of BSE. Relatively few cases of BSE have occurred in cattle born after 1993, and it is predicted that the epidemic will terminate about the year 2000 based on an extrapolation of the present declining curve. A comparison of data from the United Kingdom with data from relatively low incidence countries, such as Switzerland, indicates that this epidemic has been mainly confined to the United Kingdom because of a unique concatenation of risk factors, including: 1) a high ratio of sheep to cattle; 2) a relatively high rate of endemic scrapie; 3) the heavy feeding of MBM to dairy cattle; and 4) changes in the rendering process used to prepare MBM. Recently, cases of a variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (a TSE of humans) have been reported in the United Kingdom. These cases, at least 10 of which had onset in 1994-1995, are distinguished by their occurrence in subjects under age 40 years, by their clinical presentation, and by their neurohistopathologic picture. The appearance of this novel disease and its concentration in the United Kingdom have raised the question that it might represent the transmission of BSE to humans. However, the cases gave no history indicating an unusual exposure to live cattle, to the preparation of beef products, or of dietary exposure to bovine tissues, and it remains to be determined whether they are associated with BSE.

Clinical and Experimental Allergy		2008	FEB 2008	38	2	233-245	233	245	English						Primary prevention strategies of allergy so far have been aimed to fight allergy causes, by avoiding risk factors and inhibiting their mechanisms of action. The results of trials testing food or airborne allergen avoidance as a prevention strategy were, however, rather disappointing. A reverse approach for primary prevention of allergies aims to facilitate exposure to protecting factors which promote the induction of immunologic tolerance against innocuous antigens. These factors are associated with farming environment and a 'traditional lifestyle', but identification of these factors is quite difficult. Major candidates include food-borne microbes, helminths or their components, which are able to stimulate mucosal immunity, particularly in the gut. Similarly, new preventive and therapeutic strategies are being tested to induce specific food-allergen oral tolerance through the ingestion of progressively increasing doses of the offending food. This shifting of allergy prevention research from avoidance to tolerance induction will hopefully allow us to reverse the epidemic trend of allergy diseases.

J		Article		An indicator species approach for result-orientated subsidies of ecological services in grasslands - A study in Northwestern Germany		Wittig, Burghard (bwittig@uni-bremen.de) ; Kemmermann, Anne Richter gen.; Zacharias, Dietmar									Biological Conservation		2006	NOV 2006	133	2	186-197	186	197	English						Agri-environmental subsidies for grasslands of high conservation interest are usually associated with fairly strict management rules, but have not always been successful in terms of the preservation of species. A new approach now links the subsidies paid to the ecological value of a grassland site: the farmers are paid for keeping up a high plant species richness, and they can control the species richness of their sites by using vascular plants as indicator species. The method was tested in different grassland communities in six regions of Lower Saxony in Northwestern Germany, mainly addressing the question whether the number of selected indicator species was correlated with the total species richness of vascular plants and with the number of endangered species.Field work was carried out in 2004. Total species richness of vascular plants was recorded in all grassland sites, and the number of indicators was counted along two transects, usually being the diagonals of a rectangular site. Each transect was divided into three segments in which all indicators growing within 1 m distance from the transect line were recorded. In total 43 indicators were selected, mostly representing species that are fairly easy to recognise.The number of indicators was significantly positively correlated with the total number of species in all regions, also when correcting for autocorrelation (except in one region). When using grassland area as a co-variable, the same results were obtained, supporting the low significance of grassland size for the predictive ability of the method. in all regions but one, the mean number of indicators per segment was also significantly positively related to the number of red-listed and near-threatened species in the grasslands. Grassland size and transect length were found to be of minor importance for the application of the method. In conclusion, the study shows that the indicator approach is suitable for identifying those grassland sites that have a high plant species richness and a high number of endangered species. It may thus form the basis for result-orientated subsidies in grasslands. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The authors show the water bodies to increase their content of biogenic elements at the expense of the organic form. They mark some changes in the structure of algoflora. The abundance of alkophylic species of periphytone was found to increase, likewise the concentration of chlorphyll and the numbers of blue-green algae. The zooplankton community undergoes some restructurization in lakes; the role of predators in total biomass is growing. The biomass and numbers of zoobenthos have considerably enlarged. The structure and distribution pattern of invertebrates in the benthic community have changed in the pool part within the region of water discharge from the fishery farm. The ichthyofauna of the water bodies so far proves to remain stable.

By nature, this river has a meso- to eutrophic character. Furthermore, the river has a high structural running water quality and a high species diversity over long distances. Its catchment area is dominated by agriculture and characterized by fertile calcareous soils. 219 river sections of 100-500 m length (overall length 69,950 m = 85.7% of the whole river length) between Vollsjoeby and the mouth of the river into the Baltic Sea were cartographically recorded and investigated (Fig. 2). In these sections all vascular hydrophytes, amphiphytes, helophytes and some haptophytes were recorded. For the vegetation survey and evaluation of the results the methods described in Kohler and Janauer (1995) were used. The "index species" of the "limes scanicus" (H. and G. Weimarck 1985) Butomus umbellatus, Sium latifolium and others with their wide area of distribution are characteristic plants for this river type. Some plant species groups, resp. some species, show characteristic distribution patterns in the course of the river: Hildenbrandia rivularis group, Potamogeton lucens group, Zostera marina group etc. Due to the species features a classification of four floristic-ecological river zones was made (zones A to D). The distribution of the macrophyte species was also characterized by a set of quantitative parameters which are "Relative Range Length", "Average Plant Quantity" and "Average Quantity Index", respectively (Figs. 3-5). Both, the plant distribution as well as the sequences of the floristic zones are less to be seen as a consequence of a trophic gradient, but as a consequence of different river dynamics of velocity of flow, sediment quality as well as of salt water influence. The diagnostic features also served to determine the relation between plant distribution and environmental factors (shading, cattle grazing). Hildenbrandia rivularis mainly occurs in shaded areas, Elodea canadensis in unshaded ones. In sections influenced by cattle tracks there is an increased occurrence of Alopecurus geniculatus, Agrostis stolonifera and Glyceria fluitans. The reasons for the high species diversity of this eutrophic river are a relatively high water quality, a high amount of habitat structures, a variety of vegetational structures and various land use patterns in the surrounding area. Recommendations for the preservation and the improvement of the ecological conditions are made. For the conservation of the biological diversity of the river, hydraulic engineering measures should be avoided. Along considerable river sections suffering from cattle grazing, vegetation could be achieved by partial exclusion of the cattle, and in some sections buffer zones along the river should be established.

In addition, the incidence of E. coli O157:H7 in Hungarian ex-farm raw milks was also determined. The results showed that the Mini-VIDAS E. coli O157 (ECO) system was superior to conventional methods, with sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy percentages of 100, 97.9, and 99.3, respectively. Two hundred and fifty ex-farm raw milk samples were tested in Mini-VIDAS-ECO and concurrently by a traditional protocol, US Food and Drug Administration Bacteriological Analytical Manual Method C. The latter method gave 65 negative and 185 uncertain results, which required further identification, whereas the Mini-VIDAS-ECO gave 1 positive and 249 negative results. With both methods, only 1 out of 250 samples tested was finally confirmed positive. In conclusion, Mink VIDAS-ECO proved to be a potent tool for detection of E coli O157:H7 in raw milk.

Livestock Science		2006	JUL 2006	102	3	237-242	237	242	English						The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of intestinal parasites in pig slurries from several piggeries in Alicante (Spain). Pig slurries were collected in five highly-intensive pig farms (A-E), being sampled in each farm from the pits depending on the production cycle (gestating sows, farrowing sows, weaners, finishers). Samples were concentrated either through zinc sulphate flotation or by formalin-ethyl acetate sedimentation methods. Parasitological examination was performed by optical microscopy. Detection of Cryptosporidium sp. was performed using conventional acid-fast stain and by DNA extraction and PCR amplification. Cryptosporidium genus-specific primers (CPBDIAGF and CPBDIAGR) were used to amplify the Cryptosporidium SSU-rRNA variable region. Intestinal parasites were found in all farms studied. Several protozoa (Ballantidium coli, Entamoeba coli and Cryptosposidium sp.) and helminths (Ascaris suum, Trichuris suis, Fasciola hepatica, Strongylida and nematode larvae) were identified. Parasite viability studies are needed in order to assess the potential risk for animal and human health. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J		Article	Literature Review	Ornithologists and ornithosis: Do contact with birds endanger human health? A review with additional remarks on cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis and alveolitis		Bosch, Stefan									Vogelwarte		1999	Oct., 1999	40	1-2	130-135	130	135	German	print					Ornithosis is caused by the bacterium Chlamydia psittaci which was detected in many european wild bird species. There might be many birds affected within a species. Recently there were a few reports of human infections after cleaning nest-boxes. But this review shows, that ornithosis is a rare disease (annually 150 cases in Germany, 100 in the United States) affecting mostly people with very close contact to poultry (poultry farmers), aviaries or pigeons (breeders). There is no evidence, that cleaning of nest-boxes is of high risk. Ornithosis causes atypical pneumonia, severe headaches and fever but can efficiently be treated with antibiotics (e.g. tetracycline, chinolone, macrolide). Ornithologists have to inform their physician about the possibility of their symptoms being caused by bird contact. Further rare illnesses (histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, alveolitis) caused by birds are discussed.

J		Article		Measurement of arylsulphatase activity in agricultural soils using a simplified assay		Elsgaard, Lars; Andersen, Gitte Hastrup; Eriksen, Jorgen									Soil Biology and Biochemistry		2002	January, 2002	34	1	79-82	79	82	English	print					A simplified colorimetric assay for arylsulphatase (arylsulphate sulphohydrolase, EC 3.1.6.1) was tested with four Danish agricultural soils (clay content 4-12%). The assay was based on hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl sulphate in soil-buffer solution, but the assay was done: (i) with sample extraction by centrifugation rather than filtration; (ii) without toluene as bacteriostatic and plasmolytic agent; and (iii) with mechanical shaking of assay mixture. For the four soils, arylsulphatase activity measured after centrifugation represented 98-103% of the activity measured after filtration. Time courses (1-5 h) of p-nitrophenol evolution in the absence of toluene were linear and showed that bacteriostatic agents were not needed. Shaking increased the amount of product (24-79%) and the precision of the assay (1.5-4-fold). Unexpectedly, it was found that toluene (as a plasmolytic agent) had little effect on the arylsulphatase activity during incubation with shaking, whereas a significant increase (22-31%) occurred during static incubation. This obscured the interpretation of the arylsulphatase activity as solely extracellular when measured in the absence of toluene. With the simplified assay, the arylsulphatase activity in the four soils (0-50 cm) ranged from 0.8 to 30.5 mug p-nitrophenol g-1 dry weight soil h-1 and was correlated with the soil organic matter content (r=0.871).

Three reactor configurations were studied, a straw-packed-bed reactor, a glass packed-bed reactor and a reactor containing suspended plastic carriers. The reactor with the packed straw bed showed the best results. It had the highest methane production, 5.4 ll-1 d-1, and the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal ranged from 73-50% at organic loading rates from 2.4-25 g COD l-1 d-1. The degradation pattern of volatile fatty acids showed that the degradation of propionate and longer-chain fatty acids was limiting at higher organic loading rates. A stable effluent pH showed that the packed-bed reactors had good ability to withstand the variations in load and volatile fatty acid concentrations that can occur in the two-stage process. The conclusion is that straw would work very well in the intended application. A further benefit is that straw is a common agricultural waste product and requires only limited resources concerning handling and cost.

J		Article	Literature Review	Effects of Eucalyptus plantations on detritus, decomposers, and detritivores in streams.		Graca, Manuel A.S. (mgraca@ci.uc.pt) ; Pozo, Jesus; Canhoto, Cristina (ccanhoto@ci.uc.pt) ; Elosegi, Arturo									TheScientificWorldJOURNAL		2002	April 2002	2	Cited May 31, 2002	1173-1185	1173	1185	English	online					Eucalyptus globulus. Given that (1) leaf litter produced in the riparian areas is the main energy source for small streams, and (2) trees differ in their nutrient content, chemical defenses, and physical attributes, eucalypt plantations have the potential to affect the biology of streams. Research teams from the University of Coimbra and the University of the Basque Country have been addressing the potential effects of eucalypt plantations at several levels of study. Here we review the main conclusions of these investigations. Eucalypt plantations produced less litter than some deciduous forests. However, there were marked differences in timing of litterfall: litter production peaked during autumn in deciduous forests, whereas in the eucalypt forests it tended to peak in summer and to be more evenly distributed throughout the year. Despite these differences, the average standing stock of organic matter was higher in the eucalypt than in the deciduous forest. This may be attributed to (1) the occurrence of spates or heavy rain in autumn, the period of maximum litter fall in deciduous forests, and (2) bark accumulation in eucalypt forests. Because of differences in leaf composition, the nutrient input in eucalypt forests seems to be lower than in deciduous forests. The rate of decomposition of eucalypt leaves was strongly dependent on nutrientsin the water: in nutrient-poor waters it was slower than that of most other leaf species, whereas in nutrient-rich waters it can be as fast as alder a fast-decaying species.The biomass and cumulative diversity of aquatic hyphomycetes colonizing leaves did not differ between eucalypt and other native leaf species, but fungal sporulation generally peaked 2 weeks later on eucalypt leaves. This lag disappeared when lipids (but not polyphenolics) were chemically removed from eucalypt leaves. Similarly, addition of eucalypt oils to culture media retarded or suppressed fungal growth. spore densities) in Portugal; less consistent patterns were found in similar experiments in Spain. Eucalyptus leaves proved to be poor food for shredders. Under laboratory conditions leaves of Eucalyptus ranked low in food selection experiments using native shredders. The same shredders failed to grow and died when fed exclusively eucalypt leaves. The removal of oils from eucalypt leaves resulted in increased feedingrates, whereas the transfer of oils to alder leaves resulted in decreased feeding rates.The effect of eucalypt plantations on stream invertebrate communities is not very consistent. In nutrient-poor waters, fewer invertebrates colonized eucalypt than alder leaves, but this effect was mitigated after a microbial conditioning period in nutrient-rich waters. Portuguese streams bordered by Eucalyptus had lower numbers of invertebrates than streams surrounded by deciduous forests. In Spanish streams differences were less marked and nonexistent when looking at the composition of the communities, which change more from year to year than from site tosite. Most of the eucalypt streams studied in Portugal and Spain dried up in summer, a fact that might reflect an increase in soil hydrophobity produced by Eucalyptus plantations. The very short planting-to-harvest period of eucalypt plantations results in additional impacts, such as soil loss, siltation of streams, or reduced amounts of woody debris in stream channels, which affects their capacity to retain leaf-litter, as well asthe availability of habitat for invertebrates and fish. The studies by the Portuguese and Spanish research teams confirm the importance of maintaining riparian buffer strips to reduce human impact on streams and rivers.

J		Article		Diatoms as indicators of stream quality in the Kathmandu Valley and Middle Hills of Nepal and India.		Juttner, Ingrid (ingrid.juettner@nmgw.ac.uk) ; Sharma, Subodh; Dahal, Bed Mani; Ormerod, S. J.; Chimonides, P. James; Cox, Eileen J.									Freshwater Biology		2003	November 2003	48	11	2065-2084	2065	2084	English	print					1. Diatoms are recognised as indicators in temperate streams, but only recently have assessments begun of their value in indicating stream quality in the tropics and subtropics. Here, we extend previous studies by assessing stream diatom assemblages in relation to water quality and habitat character in the Kathmandu Valley, and in the Middle Hills of Nepal and northern India. We also assessed whether the U.K. Trophic Diatom Index (TDI) was sufficiently portable to reveal pollution in Himalayan rivers. In the more urbanised and highly agricultural Kathmandu Valley, we compared diatom response to water quality classes indicated by a local invertebrate index, the Nepalese Biotic Score (NEPBIOS). 2. Thirty and 53 streams in the Kathmandu Valley (2000) and Middle Hills (1994-96), respectively, were sampled in October and November during stable flows following the monsoon. Diatoms were collected in riffles, water samples taken for chemical analysis, and habitat character of the stream channel, bank and catchment assessed using river habitat surveys. In the Kathmandu Valley, macroinvertebrates were collected by kick-sampling. 3. In total, 113 diatom taxa were found in the Kathmandu Valley streams and 106 in the Middle Hills. Of 168 taxa recorded, 62 occurred only in the Kathmandu Valley, 56 only in the Middle Hills and 50 were common to both areas. Most taxa found only in the Kathmandu Valley belonged to the genus Navicula while most taxa confined to the Middle Hills were Achnanthes, Fragilaria and Gomphonema. 4. In the Kathmandu Valley, richness and diversity increased significantly with K, Cl, SO4 and NO3, but declined significantly with Al, Fe, surfactants and phenols. Richness here also varied with habitat structure, being lowest in fast flowing, shaded streams with coarse substrata in forested catchments. In all streams combined, richness increased significantly with Si, Na and PO4, but declined significantly with increasing pH, Ca and Mg. 5. Diatom assemblage composition in the Kathmandu Valley strongly reflected water chemistry as revealed by cations (K, Na, Mg, Ca), anions (Cl, SO4), nutrients (NO3, PO4, Si), and also substratum composition, flow character and catchment land use. The commonest taxa in base-poor forested catchments were Achnanthes siamlinearis, A. subhudsonis, A. undata and an unidentified Gomphonema species; Cocconeis placentula and Navicula minima in agricultural catchments; and Mayamaea atomus var. alcimonica, M. atomus var. permitis, and Nitzschia palea at polluted sites near settlements. Diatom assemblages in none-agricultural catchments of the Kathmandu Valley and Middle Hills were similar, but they contrasted strongly between urban or agricultural catchments of the Kathmandu Valley and the less intensively farmed catchments of the Middle Hills. 6. In keeping with variations in assemblage composition, most streams in the Kathmandu Valley had higher TDI values (33-87, median = 64) and more pollution tolerant taxa (0-78%, median = 16) than streams in the Middle Hills (25-82, median 45, 0-26%, median = 2). TDI values correlated significantly with measured PO4, Si, and Na concentrations in the Kathmandu Valley, and with Si and Na concentrations in the Middle Hills. There was some consistency between water quality classes revealed by NEPBIOS and diatoms, but also some contrast. Water quality class I-II sites had lower TDI values and were less species rich than water quality II sites, however, there were no significant differences in detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) assemblage scores and relative abundances of pollution tolerant taxa between NEPBIOS classes. 7. While diatoms in the Middle Hills indicate unpolluted or only mildly enriched conditions, they reveal pronounced eutrophication and organic pollution in the densely populated Kathmandu Valley. In addition, diatoms appear to respond to altered habitats in rural agricultural and urban areas. As demands on water resources in this region are likely to increase, we advocate the continued development of diatoms as indicators using methods based on what appear to be consistent responses in the TDI between Europe and the Himalaya.

Crop Protection		2002	November 2002	21	9	741-749	741	749	English	print					The efficacy of chloropicrin (CP) as a possible alternative fumigant to methyl bromide (MB) was investigated in tomato production systems in Northern (Albenga, Liguria) and Southern (Acate, Sicily) Italy, in six experimental trials. Two different application methods were tested: soil injection using traditional shank fumigation equipment and drip fumigation through the irrigation systems using different amounts of water to deliver CP. In the presence of severe attacks of Verticillium dahliae, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici, CP applied by shank injection at rates gtoreq30g/m2, provided a satisfactory and consistent control of tomato diseases, without causing phytotoxicity. However, CP applied by shank injection at 30 or 40 g/m2 was less effective than MB applied using the standard rate (60 g/m2) and method. The concentration of CP providing the most control of fungal pathogens ranged from 400 to 700 mul/l. CP efficacy applied through the drip irrigation systems seemed affected by the amount of irrigation water more than the application rate or concentration. Soil type and organic matter content may influence the efficacy of the treatment, particularly when CP is applied through shank injection. With this type of application, the same application rate of CP was more effective in Acate soil that contains more sand and less organic matter than in Albenga soil. For any application rate of CP, the efficacy of drip fumigation was greater than shank injection, particularly in the Albenga soil.	Gullino, M. L.; Di. Va.

B		Book		Managing Soil Quality: Challenges in Modern Agriculture					Schjonning, P; Elmholt, S; Christensen, BT						Managing Soil Quality: Challenges in Modern Agriculture		2004							English						This 368-page book identifies key issues in soil quality and management options to enhance the sustainability of modern agriculture. The book is structured into 18 individually-authored chapters written by well-established experts from Europe, North America and Australia. The text is in English and each chapter is individually and extensively referenced. The first chapter of the book outlines soil quality management concepts and terms and the second chapter focuses on soil quality, fertility and health. Soil acidity is discussed in chapter 3 in terms of resilience and thresholds and chapter 4 covers the nitrogen cycle. Phosphorus in soil is discussed in chapter 5 both with respect to a surplus and a deficiency, and chapter 6 deals with sustainable management of potassium. Chapters 7, 8 and 9 discuss, respectively, developing and maintaining soil organic matter loads, microbial diversity in soil and the effects on crop health, and biological soil quality from biomass to biodiversity. Subsoil compaction and ways to prevent it are outlined in chapter 10 and the focus of chapter 11 is on management-induced soil structure degradation with respect to organic matter depletion and tillage. Chapters 12-16 discuss soil erosion, recyclable urban and industrial waste and the benefits and problems in agricultural use, the benefits and limitations to soil health of pesticides, systems approaches for improving soil quality, and implementing soil quality knowledge in land-use planning, respectively. The penultimate chapter, chapter 17, compares and contrasts soil quality in industrialized and developing countries, and the eighteenth and final chapter provides a synthesis of soil quality management. The book includes a list of the contributors and their respective institutions. This book will be of significant interest to post-graduate students and researchers in agronomy and in soil science, crop science and environmental science, and to stakeholders involved in issues related to land use and agricultural development.					0	3		0	0	0	CABI PUBLISHING, 875 MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE, 7TH FLOOR, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA	875 MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE, 7TH FLOOR, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA	Agriculture				0-85199-671-X(H)	Soil Science; Agriculture	10069, Biochemistry studies - Minerals; 52502, Agronomy - Miscellaneous and mixed crops; 52801, Soil science - General and methods; 54600, Pest control: general, pesticides and herbicides	Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Angiospermae [25200]; [crop; (crop)]		nitrogen; (nutrient)/potassium; (nutrient)/phosphorus; (nutrient)/pesticides; (pesticide)					tillage; applied and field techniques/land management; applied and field techniques/waste recycling; applied and field techniques		developing countries, soil erosion, soil fertility, sustainable management, soil organic matter, soil acidity, microbial diversity, nitrogen cycle, industrialized countries, organic matter depletion, subsoil compaction, urban waste, soil health, crop health, management stress, soil quality management, soil structure degradation, rural waste, systems approaches				2022-07-19	BCI:BCI200600121161

Diseases of Aquatic Organisms		1997		28	2	125-138	125	138	English						From October 1993 to December 1995, 5 Danish freshwater rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss farms were surveyed for parasites; the most comprehensive survey to date in Denmark. A total of 805 fish, aged 0+ and 1+, were examined, and the parasites were identified by light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and histochemistry. Prevalence (protozoans and metazoans) and abundance (metazoans) were recorded. The 12 protozoans found were: an intestinal diplomonadid flagellate, the ectoparasitic kinetoplastid Ichthyobodo necator, and the ciliates Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, Chilodonella piscicola, Capriniana (Trichophrya) sp., Trichodina nigra, T. mutabilis, T. fultoni, Trichodinella epizootica, Apiosoma sp., Ambiphrya sp. and Epistylis sp. The 10 metazoan species found were: the myxosporean organism PKX, the monogeneans Gyrodactylus derjavini and G. salaris, the digeneans Diplostomum spathaceum and Tylodelphys clavata, the cestodes Proteocephalus exiguus, P. longicollis, Eubothrium crassum, and Triaenophorus nodulosus, and the crustacean Argulus folidceus. The diplomonad occurred predominantly in anorectic undersized fish, and was associated with mortality. I. necator produced discoloration and epidermal hyperplasia and I. multifiliis infections were associated with mortalities. C. salaris and C. derjavini produced alterations (lesions and hyperplasia) of the host epidermis visible in the scanning electron microscope. Some D. spathaceum infections caused cataract. Prevalence of I. multifiliis increased with temperature (maximum at 16 to 20 degree C), whereas the diplomonad had highest prevalence at 1 to 5 degree C. Likewise, the gyrodactylids occurred more abundantly at lower temperatures.	Buchmann, K.; Dep. Veterinary Microbiol., Sect.

J		Article		Survey of incidence of bunts (Tilletia caries and Tilletia controversa) in the Czech Republic and susceptibility of winter wheat cultivars		Vanova, Marie (vanovam@vukrom.cz) ; Matusinsky, Pavel; Benada, Jaroslav									Plant Protection Science		2006	MAR 2006	42	1	21-25	21	25	English						Bunts (caused by Tilletia caries and T controversa) belong to very important diseases of winter wheat because contaminated commodities (seeds, foods and feeds) affect the marketability of the crop on both domestic and export markets. They can be relatively easily controlled by chemical seed treatments. Due to the availability of effective chemical control, the reaction of wheat cultivars to bunts has so far not been an important trait for plant breeders in some areas of the world. However, if synthetic chemicals are not allowed, like in organic farming, untreated seed may quickly lead to a build-up of bunt to levels that render the crop unmarketable. The use of wheat cultivars partially or fully resistant to bunts could greatly contribute to ease the bunt problem. The reaction of winter wheat cultivars was evaluated in field tests. Seeds of winter wheat were inoculated with teliospores of T caries. The reaction to T controversa was studied under heavy natural infestation with spores in the soil. With T caries, the heaviest infection was found in cvs Drifter and Ebi, while cvs Nela, Brea and Samanta had the lowest. The average level of infection with T controversa was higher than that of T caries. The cvs Niagara, Brea and Versailles had significantly lower numbers of bunt ears of T controversa in 2002. The incidence of both bunts in grain samples that had not been cleaned and sorted after harvest was monitored for 4 years. A total of 1058 samples collected from various locations in the Czech Republic were analysed for the presence of bunt spores and the species determined. The investigation demonstrated a rather widespread occurrence of bunts across the Czech Republic, with T controversa being more frequent.

J		Article		Microbiological controls across the productive cycle of Dicentrarchus labrax L. and Sparus aurata L: A study from the environment to the final product.		Caruso, G. (caruso@ist.me.cnr.it) ; Maimone, G.; Mancuso, M.; Modica, A.; Genovese, L.									Aquaculture Research		2004	30 January, 2004	35	2	184-193	184	193	English	print					The microbiological quality of water, sediments and seafood products of three Sicilian marine fish farms (Castellammare Gulf, Capo d'Orlando and Porto Palo) was investigated in order to draw a complete picture of the health conditions from the start (environment) to the end (seafood product) of the productive cycle. Before the beginning of fish farming, low concentrations of faecal contamination indicators (faecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, enterococci) were found in the water of each examined area. Due to the enhanced organic load released from cages, the set-up of fish farming significantly altered the distribution of faecal indicators and sometimes that of halophilic vibrios in the pelagic compartment. Significant differences in the density of heterotrophic bacteria were sometimes recorded at the sediment level. Despite this increase in microbial abundance, the microbiological conditions remained acceptable for the productive process. Pathogens (Salmonella spp., Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus) were mostly absent in seafood products. The study underlines that the achievement of good quality levels in aquaculture strongly depends on the conformity of the rearing environment to qualitative microbiological standards, highlighting the importance of sanitary controls along the different steps of the productive cycle.

J	16393330	Article		Agents causing occupational asthma in Finland in 1986-2002: Cow epithelium bypassed by moulds from moisture-damaged buildings		Piipari, R. (Ritva.Piipari@ttl.fi) ; Keskinen, H.									Clinical and Experimental Allergy		2005	DEC 2005	35	12	1632-1637	1632	1637	English						Occupational asthma is an avoidable form of asthma. In Finland, the diagnosis of occupational asthma entitles substantial compensation to the employee. The diagnostics are based on symptoms, exposure assessment, allergologic investigations, follow-up of peak expiratory flow (PEF) at work and at home and, in many cases, specific challenge tests.To study the causative agents of occupational asthma in Finland.The causative agents and the numbers of new occupational asthma cases notified to the Finnish Register of Occupational Diseases (FROD) during 1986-2002 are reported.The number of occupational asthma cases increased from 1986 until 1995, after which a downward trend, stabilizing during the last few years, has been observed. The majority of the cases (59%) in the beginning of the period (1986-1990) were associated with agriculture, but the percentage has fallen thereafter (42% of the cases in 1998-2002) along with the fall in the total number of cases. Since 1995, indoor moulds from water-damaged buildings have caused an increasing number of cases and have become the most important causative agents (0.5% cases, in 1986-1990 and 18% of the cases in 1998-2002). Chemicals have caused 10-30% of the cases, a decreasing number since 1990. The most important chemicals causing occupational asthma have been diisocyanates and welding fumes, followed by hairdressing chemicals and formaldehyde.The number of occupational asthma cases in Finland reached its height in the mid-1990s. The decrease in the number of total cases is because of the decrease in agriculture-associated cases, reflecting the number of employees in agriculture-associated occupations, which has greatly decreased since Finland joined the EU in 1995. An epidemic of mould-induced asthma, affecting mostly white-collar employees working in moisture-damaged buildings, has taken place since 1995.

J	18943298	Article		Analysis of summer epidemic progress of apple scab at different apple production systems in the Netherlands and Hungary		Holb, I. J. (holb@agr.unideb.hu) ; Heijne, B.; Withagen, J. C. M.; Gall, J. M.; Jeger, M. J.									Phytopathology		2005	SEP 2005	95	9	1001-1020	1001	1020	English						Two, 4-year studies on summer epidemic progress of apple scab were conducted at Randwijk, the Netherlands, from 1998 until 2001 and at Eperjeske, Hungary, from 2000 until 2003. Disease assessments were made on scab-susceptible cv. Jonagold. A range of nonlinear growth functions were fitted to a total of 96 disease progress curves (3 treatment classes x 2 plant parts x 2 disease measures x 4 years x 2 locations) of apple scab incidence and severity. The three-parameter logistic model gave the most consistent fit across three treatment classes in the experiment (integrated, organic-sprayed, and organic-unsprayed). Parameters estimated or calculated from the three-parameter logistic function were used to analyze disease progress. These were disease incidence and severity on the day of the first assessment (Y-s); final disease incidence or upper asymptote for incidence (Y-if) or severity (Y-sf); fruit incidence and severity on day 40, after which no new lesions on fruits appeared (Y-40); leaf incidence and severity on day 75, at which shoot growth stopped (Y-75); relative (beta) and "absolute" (theta) rates of disease progress; inflection point (M); and area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC(5)) standardized by the duration of the total epidemic. Comparisons among disease progress curves were made by Correlation and factor analysis followed by Varimax rotation. There were large differences but high positive correlations among the parameters Y-s, Y-f, theta, and AUDPC(5) across the three treatment classes. In the factor analysis, two factors accounted for more than 85% of the total variance for both incidence and severity. Factor I gave an overall description of epidemic progress of both scab incidence and severity and included the parameters Y-f, Y-40, Y-75, theta, and AUDPCs. Factor 2 identified a relationship between the relative rate parameter (P) and the inflection point (M) for severity and a relationship between disease incidence and severity. For an integrated or an organic orchard, theta, AUDPC(5), and one of Y-f or Y-75 (because of the link with host phenology) can characterize apple scab epidemics during summer. Based on these findings, improved scab management approaches were provided for integrated and organic apple production systems.	Holb, I.

J	18925555	Article		Cattle farmers' perception of the nuisances caused by insects and ticks to cattle in the Canton Jura		Lovis, L.; Mascher, V. Frutschi; Gern, L.; Betschart, B.; Zinsstag, J. (jakob.zinsstag@unibas.ch)									Schweizer Archiv fuer Tierheilkunde		2008	SEP 2008	150	9	457-465	457	465	German						During summer 2005, a survery of 172 farmers from the Canton Jura was carried out to determine their perception of the nuisances caused by insects and ticks to cattle. The presence of ticks was significantly more often spontaneously mentioned by farmers in the Clos-du-Doubs and in the district of Delemont (95% and 72%, respectively) than in Ajoie and in the Franches-Montagnes (29% and 19%, respectively, p < 0.0001). 20% of the farmers perceived the tick populations to be increasing. The following diseases were spontaneously listed: keratoconjunctivitis (59%), mastitis related to flies (31%), hypodermosis (15%), ehrlichiosis (12%) and babesiosis (10%). Suspicion of ehrlichiosis was significantly more often mentioned in the district of Delemont than in the rest of the canton (p < 0.001) which was associated with the presence of ticks observed by farmers (p < 0.00 1). Cases of clinical babesiosis, which is common in the Clos-du-Doubs, were mentioned by farmers outside this area: Delemont (3/57) and Ajoie (1/26). In this study babesiosis depends on the production area, on the presence of ticks observed by farmers and on the presence of water in the pasture (p < 0.05). This study shows that cattle farmers are well aware of the presence of the diseases linked to insects and ticks and that the perception of their distribution is in accordance with the epidemiological data. An overview of the epidemiology of tick- and insect-related diseases can therefore be established by surveying farmers' perception, but should then be confirmed by a biomedical study. Due to their accurate observations, farmers are key participants at the first level of surveillance systems of animal diseases.

J		Article		Control of the European grapevine moth Lobesia botrana in Greece by the mating disruption technique: A three-year survey.		Moschos, Theodoros (moschosth@hotmail.com, bpilibr@otenet.gr) ; Souliotis, C.; Broumas, T.; Kapothanassi, V.									Phytoparasitica		2004	January 2004	32	1	83-96	83	96	English	print					During 1996-1998 mating disruption trials were conducted on all three generations of the grapevine moth Lobesia botrana Den. et Schiff. (Lep., Tortricidae) in a 25-ha vineyard situated at Spata, Attiki, Greece. Shortly before the beginning of the first flight period ampoule-type pheromone dispensers were set up lining a 6.5-ha rectangular plot. Around the dispenser zone a protection belt was created where Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and selective insecticides were applied against the second and third generation larvae. The protection belt was 35 m wide and covered 3.5 ha. The rest of the vineyard was divided into the reference plot - where conventional insecticide treatments were implemented to control both carpophagous pest generations, and the untreated control plot - which measured 1 ha. Male catches within the dispenser zone were virtually zero. Nevertheless, no difference was apparent between the percentage of mated females from within and outside of the dispenser zone. Attractant was released from the dispensers throughout the season at a rather constant rate, but by the middle of the third flight period dispensers were found to be almost empty. During the 3 years of the survey pest pressure was often at exceptionally high levels. The effectiveness of the mating disruption technique (MDT) was found to vary with year and pest generation. MDT was used against the first (anthophagous) generation with rather poor results. In the following carpophagous generations results were comparable to control measures with insecticides used and sometimes slightly better. The density of the pest population in the pheromone-treated vineyard as compared with the untreated control, was reduced on average by 67% in the second and by 57% in the third generation. MDT therefore did not accomplish sufficient crop protection.

J		Article		Reduction of aquaculture wastewater eutrophication by phytotreatment ponds system: II. Nitrogen and phosphorus content in macroalgae and sediment.		Porrello, Salvatore (s.porrello@icram.org) ; Lenzi, Mauro; Tomassetti, Paolo; Persia, Emma; Finoia, Maria Grazia; Mercatali, Isabel									Aquaculture		2003	2 April, 2003	219	1-4	531-544	531	544	English	print					The presence of intensive fish farms in the Orbetello Lagoon (Italian West Coast) has produced a heavy impact on the environment and has led to a large-scale cyclic development of opportunistic macroalgae. The farms are equipped with phytotreatment basins to treat the effluent. Although it is possible to find reports in the literature of phytotreatment techniques suitable for fish-farming effluents, they refer solely to pilot scale. The flooded areas used for phytotreatment permit the growth of huge quantities of macroalgae, which remove nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from the effluent. These ponds are unmanaged, and N and P are released when this vegetation dies during the Summer. Between June 1999 and May 2000 research was carried out on an intensive fish-farming facility that produces about 100 tonnes per year of European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.) and gilt head sea bream (Sparus aurata L.), occupying a volume of 9000 m3. The wastewater from the plant is discharged to four phytotreatment ponds, arranged in series, and, ultimately, released into the nearby sea-lagoon canal. The research aims were: (a) to quantify the N and P in the effluent from an intensive fish farm facility which are retained by the macroalgae and sediments as the effluent passes through the phytotreatment system; (b) to detect any seasonal variations in nutrient distribution; (c) to determine spatial distribution of the nutrients between input and output of the phytotreatment system. During the test period the physico-chemical parameters of the water were recorded; sediment total organic carbon (STOC), sediment total nitrogen (STN), sediment total phosphorus (STP), macroalgal total carbon (MTC), macroalgal total nitrogen (MTN) and macroalgal total phosphorus (MTP) were determined. Also the micro- and macroalgal biomasses were determined and a floristic list was made. The data collected over the test period were subjected to discriminant type multivariate analysis. The results indicate that: (1) the system size and water residence time are not sufficient to produce adequate abatement; (2) the quantity of nutrients involved in this system is too high for the system itself to be controlled by macroalgal growth alone; (3) the Ulva rigida biomass develops over too short a period of the year (February-June) and is accompanied by rapid decomposition that produces extreme environmental conditions.

J		Article		The Nordruegensche Boddengewaesser - Aspects of microbial ecology of an unique environment		Meyer-Reil, Lutz-Arend									Ergebnisse der Limnologie		1999		0	54	33-42	33	42	English	print					The Nordruegensche Bodden (coastal inlets of the southern Baltic Sea, Germany) consist of a chain of rich structured, shallow water basins some of which communicate only via small connections. During the last decades, especially the inner Bodden became highly eutrophic because of the input of nutrients from agriculture and municipal sewage. The Bodden are characterized by pronounced gradients of biological and chemical parameters. Whereas salinity decreases, inorganic nutrients, chlorophyll a, seston, microbial biomass, concentration and microbial decomposition of organic material increase from the outer to the inner Bodden with increasing distance from the Baltic Sea. Because of the high sediment surface to water volume, sediments play the dominating role in the nutrient balance of the Bodden. The grade of eutrophication is reflected by the structure and metabolic activities of microbial autohetero-trophic biofilms (Aufwuchs) colonizing the rocky shore. With increasing eutrophicationprimary production decreases, whereas heterotrophic processes gain increasing importance. The future of the Nordruegensche Bodden is discussed with special emphasis to the serious eutrophication in the innermost Kleiner Jasmunder Bodden.

J	15121716	Article		Cohort study of sibling effect, infectious diseases, and risk of atopic dermatitis during first 18 months of life		Benn, Christine Stabell (C.Benn.cb@ssi.dk) ; Melbye, Mads; Wohlfahrt, Jan; Bjorksten, Bengt; Aaby, Peter									BMJ		2004	May 22, 2004	328	7450	1223-1226	1223	1226	English	print					Objectives To determine whether early infectious diseases could explain the association between number of siblings and other markers of microbial exposure and the development of atopic dermatitis before the age of 18 months. Design Cohort study. Information on atopic dermatitis, infectious diseases occurring before 6 months of age, number of siblings, early day care, pet keeping, farm residence, and background factors was collected in telephone interviews. Setting Danish national birth cohort. Participants 24341 mother-child pairs. Main outcome measures Incidence rate ratios of atopic dermatitis. Results 13070 children (54%) had at least one clinically apparent infectious disease before 6 months of age. At age 18 months, 2638 (10.8%) of the children had had atopic dermatitis. The risk of atopic dermatitis increased with each infectious disease before 6 months of age (incidence rate ratio 1.08,95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.13). The risk of atopic dermatitis decreased with each additional exposure to three or more siblings, day care, pet ownership, and farm residence (0.86, 0.81 to 0.93). Conclusions Early infections do not seem to protect against allergic diseases. The protective effect of number of siblings, day care, pet ownership, and farm residence remained after adjustment for clinically apparent infectious diseases, suggesting that the effect is established independently early in life.

The study revealed that foals, young horses and adults were respectively treated an average of 4.3, 4.0 and 3.7 times annually. The most commonly used drug during the period 1993-1995 was ivermectin. On average 2.4 different drugs were used in each herd annually The individual weight of the horse was used by 75% of farm owners to determine the dose of anthelmintic. The most commonly used weight estimation method was eye measure (80% of owners). This results in a high risk of underdosing. Other methods such as girthtapes or liveweight were seldom used. Sixty two percent of the herd owners treated at turn out, 57% treated when buying new horses, 26% treated when stabling visiting horses, 78% applied pasture rotation and 18% performed alternate/-mixed grazing. Thirty two percent of the herd owners maintained treatment journals. The herd owners obtained their information about endoparasite control from veterinary practitioners, meetings and papers in that order of importance.

Clinical Infectious Diseases		2007	SEP 1 2007	45	5	534-540	534	540	English						Background. Noroviruses are enterically transmitted and are a frequent cause of gastroenteritis, affecting 23 million people annually in the United States. We describe a norovirus outbreak and its control in a tertiary care hospital during February-May 2004.Methods. Patients and health care workers met the case definition if they had new onset of vomiting and/ or diarrhea during the outbreak period. Selected stool samples were tested for norovirus RNA. We also determined outbreak costs, including the estimated lost revenue associated with unit closures, sick leave, and cleaning expenses.Results. We identified 355 cases that affected 90 patients and 265 health care workers and that were clustered in the coronary care unit and psychiatry units. Attack rates were 5.3% ( 7 of 133) for patients and 29.9% ( 29 of 97) for health care workers in the coronary care unit and 16.7% ( 39 of 233) for patients and 38.0% ( 76 of 200) for health care workers in the psychiatry units. Thirteen affected health care workers (4.9%) required emergency department visits or hospitalization. Detected noroviruses had 98%-99% sequence identity with representatives of a new genogroup II.4 variant that emerged during 2002-2004 in the United States ( e. g., Farmington Hills and other strains) and Europe. Aggressive infection-control measures, including closure of units and thorough disinfection using sodium hypochlorite, were required to terminate the outbreak. Costs associated with this outbreak were estimated to be $657,644.Conclusions. The significant disruption of patient care and cost of this single nosocomial outbreak support aggressive efforts to prevent transmission of noroviruses in health care settings.

Bohner, Andreas (andreas.bohner@bal.bmlf.gv.at) ; Grims, Franz; Sobotik, Monika; Zechner, Lisbeth (lisbeth.zechner@kfunigraz.ac.at)									Tuexenia		2003			23	199-225	199	225	German	print					The Mesobrometum erecti occurs in the semi-dry conditions of the research area (middle of the Styrian Enns valley, Austria). The soil is usually shallow and low in nutrients, with high base saturation, and is mainly in the carbonate buffer range. It also has a relatively high electrical conductivity and low contents of lactate and water-soluble P2O5. It is often supersaturated with Ca2+. The low availability of phosphorus seems to be the main limiting factor for plant growth. Syntaxonomical classification closely follows the different amounts of clay in the soil, which lead to different temperature, water and nutrient conditions. The subassociation of Colchicum autumnale is typical in the clay-rich rendzic leptosols. These sites are characterised by semi-dry conditions with periodic moistening. The typical subassociation occurs on calcaric cambisols with low clay content. These sites are semi-dry. The Bromus erectus semi-dry grassland is characterised by many hemicryptophytes. The root-shoot ratio is higher than in the Alchemillo monticolae-Arrhenatheretum. One of the most important features of Poaceae and Cyperaceae root anatomy in semi-dry conditions is a wide stele and a narrow cortex, with an irregular arrangement of cortex cells with triangular intercellulars. The roots of Bromus erectus plants are highly infected by mycorrhiza. The Bromus erectus semi-dry grassland has lower yield and fodder quality than manured grassland. The feed intake is almost similar. The plants of the Bromus erectus semi-dry grassland display a relatively efficient uptake of mineral nutrients (relatively high nutrient-use efficiency). The Mesobrometum erecti is one of the most species-rich plant communities in the research area and an important biotope for many rare and protected plant and animal species. The high species richness occurs on semi-dry, nutrient-poor sites, where many mesophytes and xerophytes find good growth conditions. Care and protection of the semi-dry grassland is an important task for agriculture. Only late mowing or extensive grazing guarantees the protection of these plant communities.

J		Article		Effects of land use and fish stocking on a mountain lake: Evidence from the sediment		Brancelj, Anton; Sisko, Milijan; Brancelj, Irena Rejec; Jeran, Zvonka; Jacimovic, Radojko									Periodicum Biologorum		2000	October, 2000	102	3	259-268	259	268	English	print					Background and purpose: Mountain and high-mountain lakes all over the Alps were originally without fish. In medieval times, a lot of lakes were stocked with fish, but not in Slovenia. Lake Jezero Na Planini Pri Jezeru (1430 m a.s.l.; NW Slovenia) was stocked in 1951. Other human activities, particularly forges and alpine diary farming, were known there since the 14th century. From 1950 onward tourism has became an important human activity around the lake too. Today the lake is highly eutrophic. To reveal the main milestones during eutrophication process of the lake analyses of the sediment were done. Material and Methods: A sediment corer was employed to get a 40 cm long sediment core from the deepest point of the lake. The core was immediately sliced into 0.5-1 cm thin slices for further analyses. Dating (210Pb method) and analyses of physical properties of the sediment (dry weight, loss-on-ignition) as well as analyses of diatom and Cladocera remains were performed to reconstruct events in the lake's catchment and lake itself. Historical data were used to comment results obtained from the sediment analyses. Results: Forging, associated with clear-cutting influenced the lake since the very beginning but the most destructive influence had introduction of fish in 1951. A change in zooplankton community started at that time and was enhanced after hotel reconstruction in mid 80s. The result is highly eutrophic lake with permanent depletion of oxygen below 5 m and low Secchi-disc depth. Prevalence of small-bodied zooplankton Crustacea, with Eubosmina as the most abundant species, is characteristic for the present situation. Diatom species, Stephanodiscus parvus, an indicator of eutrophication, is very common, too. Conclusion: Anthropogenic influence of the lake started almost five centuries ago, but was moderate till 1950. Homeostasis of the lake was strong enough to neutralize most of the negative effects of human activities and the result was low eutrophication. Fish introduction in mid 1950s and increase in tourism and activities associated with it have definitely destroyed lake homeostasis and started intensive eutrofication.

The serologic survey revealed evidence of infection with herpesviruses in deer in Germany, as indicated by the prevalence of serum neutralizing antibodies to the cervid herpesvirus 1 (HVC-1), bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), and caprine herpesvirus 1 (CapHV-1). Forty-six sera (13.3%) with titers from 1:4 to 1:256 were detected. The antibodies were present in free-living and farmed deer. There was no significant difference in antibody prevalence among deer in habitats with high, intermediate, or low density of cattle. Most of the seropositive animals and the highest titers were detected using CapHV-1 rather than HVC-1 antigens. This finding suggests that the herpesvirus strain that infects wild ruminants in Germany is closer to CapHV-1 in its antigenic structure than to BHV-1 or HVC-1.	Inst. Zoo Biol. Wildlife Res.

J		Article		SYSTEMS MODELING AS AN APPROACH TO PEST MANAGEMENT		BAKER E A									Bulletin OEPP		1976		6	2	47-55	47	55	English						Emphasis is placed upon the value of a systems approach as a tool for interrelating the complex interdisciplinary components of the increasingly desirable pest management programs. A brief outline of the parameters incorporated and construction of a mathematical model are given. Selected examples are given of models being implemented at present, and the benefits arising from them, such as in the cotton, alfalfa and apple ecosystems in the USA. Future effectuation, in Europe, of complete pest management schemes for plant diseases and nematodes, insects and mites, birds, rodents and weeds is needed, but will require concerted co-operation between governments and organizations to initiate programs comparable to those implemented in the USA. Provision should be made for some form of extension/education system, such that the methods and benefits will be realized.					0	2		0	0	0			Agriculture; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Entomology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Biodiversity & Conservation	0250-8052				Agronomy (Agriculture); Computer Applications (Computational Biology); Economic Entomology; Mathematical Biology (Computational Biology); Pest Assessment Control and Management; Wildlife Management (Conservation)	00514, General biology - General textbooks and audio-visual aids; 00530, General biology - Information, documentation, retrieval and computer applications; 04500, Mathematical biology and statistical methods; 07518, Ecology: environmental biology - Wildlife management: terrestrial; 10515, Biophysics - Biocybernetics; 52502, Agronomy - Miscellaneous and mixed crops; 52506, Agronomy - Forage crops and fodder; 52508, Agronomy - Fiber crops; 52518, Agronomy - Weed control; 53002, Horticulture - Temperate zone fruits and nuts; 54516, Phytopathology - Disease control; 54518, Phytopathology - General and miscellaneous; 54600, Pest control: general, pesticides and herbicides; 60002, Economic entomology - General; 60004, Economic entomology - Field, flower and truck crops; 60006, Economic entomology - Fruits and nuts	Microorganisms; Microorganisms; Microorganisms [01000]/Plantae; Plants; Plantae [11000]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Leguminosae [26260]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Malvaceae [26330]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Rosaceae [26675]/Aschelminthes, Helminthes, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Aschelminths, Helminths, Invertebrates; Nematoda [51300]/Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Insects, Invertebrates; Insecta [75300]/Chelicerata, Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Chelicerates, Invertebrates; Acarina [75403]/Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Aves [85500]/Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Rodents, Vertebrates; Rodentia [86265]									USA EUROPE COTTON ALFALFA APPLE DISEASES NEMATODES INSECTS MITES BIRDS RODENTS WEEDS EDUCATION				2022-07-19	BCI:BCI197763010227
J	16796063	Article		Ensuring good governance to address emerging and re-emerging animal disease threats: supporting the Veterinary Services of developing countries to meet OIE international standards on quality		Vallat, B.; Mallet, E.									Revue Scientifique et Technique Office International des Epizooties		2006	APR 2006	25	1	389-401	389	401	English						As an effect of increased globalisation, animal diseases, in particular those transmissible to man, have an immediate global economic and social impact. This fact, dramatically illustrated by the current avian influenza epizootic in South-East Asia and Eastern Europe, clearly demonstrates the crucial importance of the national Veterinary Services (VS) for the prevention, early detection and response for the efficient control of animal diseases. Complying with this mission for the VS presupposes the existence of appropriate governance and legislation and of an official system to control their quality and reliability- an obvious weakness in many developing and in transition countries. The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has therefore developed a project aiming at strengthening the VS in those countries facing the greatest animal health threats and to bring them into line with OIE international standards already adopted by the same countries. Based on the evaluation of the VS and subsequent actions at the global, regional and national levels, the project will have a significant beneficial impact on the targeted countries as well as the international community as a whole, not only in the fields of agriculture, food security and production, and food safety, but also for the local and global prevention of emerging and re-emerging diseases of veterinary and public health importance. The project will be implemented in strong collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization. The actions proposed must be considered eligible for the concept of International Public Good.

J	10427633	Article	Literature Review	Big decisions based on small numbers: Lessons from BSE		Ridley, R. M.; Baker, H. F.									Veterinary Quarterly		1999	June, 1999	21	3	86-92	86	92	English	print					The epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) has been the most expensive disaster ever to have befallen farming in the UK. It is believed to have led to a new form of spongiform encephalopathy in humans and as yet there is no way of knowing how many people will die of this disease. In order to curtail the BSE epidemic major decisions had to be made, often on the basis of inadequate scientific data. These data may have been derived from experiments using small sample numbers. Here we review some examples of where this has happened, sometimes with a beneficial outcome and sometimes with a misleading outcome. The identification of BSE as a new disease depended on precise neuropathological observation of a small number of cases rather than the obvious occurrence of large numbers of sick animals. Similarly, the recognition that BSE may have led to disease in humans was based on the neuropathological and clinical picture of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) rather than on an increase in the number of cases of CJD in the UK. Early in the BSE epidemic the possibility that disease could be maternally transmitted from cow to calf was raised, mainly because of a belief that such transmission occurs in scrapie disease of sheep. But, we argue, the evidence for maternal transmission of scrapie, collected in the 1960s, was based on small numbers and is inadequate. Subsequent research has shown a very substantial genetic component in scrapie and epidemiological data show no excess risk in the offspring of affected ewes relative to the risk in the offspring of affected rams. An experiment to determine whether maternal transmission occurs in BSE was flawed and was unable to distinguish between maternal transmission and genetic susceptibility to environmental contamination. An assessment of the risk of BSE to humans depends on determining the levels of infectivity in tissues and transmissibility across species. Data on both of these are deficient, so it is not possible to predict how many people in the UK or elsewhere will become affected with new variant CJD in the next fifty years. The assessment of whether BSE could be transmitted to sheep and whether sheep therefore pose a risk to humans is hampered by a serious lack of evidence about the epidemiology of scrapie in the UK and elsewhere. The UK has paid a heavy price for the BSE epidemic but lessons should be learned from the experience. Every country should have a Specified Offals Ban even if it has no cases of BSE because, by the time it has, it will be too late. Furthermore, the occasional case of BSE should not be regarded as insignificant since it may be the harbinger of an epidemic in the making.	Baker, H.

J		Article		Web-Blight: Regional late blight monitoring and variety resistance information on Internet.		Hansen, Jens G.; Lassen, Poul; Koppel, Matti; Valskyte, Alma; Turka, Inara; Kapsa, Jozefa									Journal of Plant Protection Research		2003		43	3	263-273	263	273	English	print					The Internet based 'Web-Blight' service (http://www.web-blight.net) was initiated to provide an online warning and prognosis system for potato late blight in the countries around the Baltic Sea. In order to obtain comparable results, methods were harmonized and a set of interacting PC and Internet applications were developed for use by the project partners. Results regarding monitoring of potato late blight and evaluation of variety resistance against late blight (field tests) are presented for Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. The use of the Internet to collect and present data was very successful, because information were "on the fly", helping farmers in their decisions about the timing of first applications and choice of fungicide type. Results show that it was possible to find early attacks as primary attacks (spots in the fields). In most cases attacks were initially found in home gardens and later in conventional fields. The growth stage at first attacks was often higher than 37 (BBCH) indicating that very early attacks caused by oospores in the soil was not a widespread problem. Local varieties were tested for late blight resistance in untreated field trials against four test varieties (Sava, Oleva, Danva and Kuras). Primary disease data were uploaded to Web-Blight via the Internet, and applications on the Web-Blight server calculated epidemiological variables such as delay of first symptoms and RAUDPC. Results indicated the presence of race-specific resistance in some varieties, e.g. Kuras, and that some varieties were originally misclassified according to resistance scale, e.g. Sante. The network about observation trials clearly showed that field test of variety resistance against late blight in time and space is important, taking into account the rapid evolution of Phytophthora infestans populations in Europe.

J	17825067	Article		A longitudinal study to assess the persistence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) on an intensive broiler farm in the United Kingdom		Garcia-Migura, Lourdes (lmx@food.dtu.dk) ; Liebana, Ernesto; Jensen, Lars Bogo; Barnes, Simon; Pleydell, Eve									FEMS Microbiology Letters		2007	OCT 2007	275	2	319-325	319	325	English						Seven years after the ban of avoparcin, VREF could still be isolated within sectors of the UK broiler industry. The aim of this study was to assess whether there is a carryover of VREF between consecutive flocks of birds, to conduct a preliminary investigation of possible routes of entry of VREF into broiler houses and to follow the dynamics of VREF shed by growing birds. A series of nine visits were made to two of six houses on a conventional broiler farm. A total of 343 vanA VREF were recovered from environmental (95/843) and faecal (248/416) samples. Significant differences were observed in the carryover of VREF between pre- and postcohort postcleaning and disinfection visits (RR 0.57, P=0.006). Ninety-nine percent of the VREF isolates were resistant to more than five antimicrobials, with 42 isolates (n=49) positive for erm(B) and 32 (n=40) for vat(E). Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing identified 50 PFGE types within 15 different PFGE clusters of 90% similarity, demonstrating a high level of genetic diversity within VREF populations from epidemiologically related broiler flocks and broiler houses. Further characterization of Tn1546 from different clones showed a low diversity of Tn-types, suggesting horizontal transfer of resistance determinants between different genetic clones. Thus, this study does not only show the persistence of VREF but also of multi-drug resistant lineages of VREF.

J		Article	Manual	Perception of aquatic weed problems by managers of water resources		Aguiar, Francisca; Moreira, Ilidio; Ferreira, Teresa									Revista de Ciencias Agrarias		1996		19	4	35-56	35	56	Portuguese						The assessment of current weed problems in Portuguese freshwater ecosystems was undertaken through analysis of the results of a prospective survey sent to the organizations with responsibility in territorial and water resources management. The answers concerning the local existence of the main aquatic weeds, the harmful effects, the control measures, the implied costs and the probable causes of the local spread of macrophytes in freshwater ecosystems are presented and discussed. The agricultural region Ribatejo/Oeste, in the central part of Portugal, was referred by the agricultural sub regions responsibles as the most affected by aquatic weed problems. The question related with the perception of the main aquatic weeds was crossed with their occurrence in five groups of freshwater ecosystems (rivers and streams, swamps and ponds, reservoirs, cement canals, ditches). The global analysis has revealed that macroalgae were the primary cause of aquatic weed problems in Portugal, with a preferential spread in rivers and streams; however the coordinators of the irrigation associations and of the agricultural sub regions noticed more concern with algae in cement canals and drainage ditches. The emergent macrophytes of the genera Juncus and Scirpus (rushes) appear in second place, followed by the species Phragmites australis (common reed), Arundo donax (cane), Cyperus spp. (galingales) and Typha spp. (reedmaces), frequently in drainage and irrigation ditches. For the irrigation associations the problems with reedmaces, common reed and cane are more frequent. Special mention should be made to the exotics Eichhornia crassipes (water-hyacinth), and Myriophyllum aquaticum (parrot feather); although the less relative value given for their occurrence, they are considered dominants, respectively in the Ribatejo/Oeste and Beira Litoral regions. The three groups of negative effects of excessive aquatic plant growth analyzed were the alteration of the hydrological regime, the interference in fishering and recreational activities and the adverse effects on an environmental perspective. The irrigation associations detached the alteration of the hydrological regime. The municipalities representatives and the coordinators of forestry departments revealed more concern with environmental problems than the other group of survey respondents. Concerning the potential causes for the aquatic plant infestations, the agricultural sub regions representatives has given more evidence to the lack of a continuous maintenance of the freshwater systems and to the abandonment or reduction of agricultural activities, the forestry departments and irrigation associations detached the alteration of the hydrological regime, while the municipality representatives found the pollution the main cause for the excessive growth of aquatic plants. The transference of water and the accidental introduction of plants, seeds or propagules, currently related with the invasion by alien species was also cited. The answers related with the control of aquatic weeds provided evidence of a low rate in its utilization, exception for the irrigation associations, and a preferential use of manual and mechanical harvesting.

J		Article		Rhizobia in Iceland		Sverrisson, Halldor									Buvisindi		1997		11	0	3-8	3	8	Icelandic	print					The aim of this article is to give some overview of properties and taxonomy of rhizobia and to summarize what is known about their distribution in Iceland. The significance of rhizobia will probably increase with growing interest in the use of legumes in agriculture and land reclamation. Rhizobial strains which are commercially available in other countries might not be suitable for use in Iceland because they are not adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The rhizobia on roots of native legumes are probably adapted to low soil temperatures. It is not likely that some exotic legume genera, like Astragalus, Hedysarum and Galega, will find effective rhizobial symbionts in Icelandic soils. Import of ornamental plants of those genera could have brought some rhizobia to private or public gardens, and some strains have been imported from microbe collections in order to inoculate experimental plants. Research on lupine rhizobia occurring in Iceland has shown variation in nitrogen fixing efficiency between different strains. Selected strains are now produced commercially by the Soil Conservation Service for inoculation of seed for land reclamation work. In Nordic research projects the ability of strains of Rhizobium loti and several other strains to grow at low temperatures has been measured, and the results showed that one of the strains could grow in vitro down to 2.7degreeC while others needed much higher temperatures. A Nordic project work has also been done on testing three Norwegian strains of Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar. trifolii for their effectiveness on white clover and the results showed that a mixture of the strains gave better yields than any single strain. Similar work with red clover and a few other legumes is now being carried out.

J		Article		Characterizing resistance risk of Erysiphe graminis f.sp. tritici to strobilurins		Chin, K. M.; Chavaillaz, D.; Kaesbohrer, M.; Staub, T.; Felsenstein, F. G.									Crop Protection		2001	March, 2001	20	2	87-96	87	96	English	print					Strobilurins have been commercially used since 1996 for the control of Erysiphe graminis on cereals in Europe. Sensitivity monitoring of airborne and field samples of the pathogen detected only sensitive populations from 1996 to 1997, but in 1998 resistant wheat isolates (resistance factors of EC50s > 500) were found in airborne samples from three different regions in North Germany. These isolates already occurred at up to 90% frequencies suggesting that resistant individuals may have high levels of fitness, and that they could have previously escaped detection with conventional methods which measure EC50s of bulk samples or which sample limited numbers of single-colony isolates per region. An alternative method measuring frequencies of resistant colonies in bulk samples at a discriminatory dose of 3 ppm trifloxystrobin relative to that at 0 ppm, showed that resistance to stobilurins can occur at frequencies which do not affect the mean EC50s of these samples. In 1999, high levels of resistance were still concentrated in parts of Germany but became detectable in other regions of the country, and in other countries including France, Belgium, UK and Denmark. Losses in performance were detected in areas with high frequencies of resistance. In a competition experiment between resistant and sensitive isolates over three generations, resistance was stable in the absence of selection; the resistant isolate appeared equal in fitness to the sensitive isolate on untreated plant material; and was rapidly selected for on strobilurin-treated material. Selection studies on bulk isolates confirmed this finding but also indicated the existence of a range of fitness levels. There were high levels of cross-resistance between strobilurins but not with demethylation inhibitors, morpholines, anilinopyrimidines and quinoxyfen. This assessment of resistance risk suggests that use recommendations of strobilurins for wheat powdery mildew control must include elements for strict resistance management.	Chin, K.

J		Article		Assessment of highly polluted fluvisol in the Spittelwasser floodplain - Based on national guideline values and MNA-Criteria		Schwartz, Rene (schwartz@tu-harburg.de) ; Gerth, Joachim; Neumann-Hensel, Helga; Bley, Sonja; Forstner, Ulrich									Journal of Soils and Sediments		2006	AUG 2006	6	3	145-155	145	155	English						Background, Goal and Scope. Nearly all large European rivers have been used as disposal pathways for several unwanted substances. Deposition of the contaminated solids occurs in regions of slack water and also during floods in adjacent floodplains. As a result of the recurrent input, most of the floodplains in central Europe are contaminated by manifold inorganic and organic pollutants, representing a risk for both plants and groundwater at the site, and for areas downstream. The aim of the present paper is to demonstrate and assess the sink and source functions of a highly contaminated 'fluvisol' (= alluvial soil) for inorganic and persistent organic pollutants. The extent of contamination is described on the basis of national guidelines. These results are further discussed on the basis of the 'monitored natural attenuation' (MNA) potential, i.e., with respect to the requirements for the cheapest problem solution for large scale contamination of floodplains. The MNA potential is assessed according to several lines of evidence such as contaminant burial, mechanical and chemical mobility, transformation to less toxic forms, and dilution due to dispersion.Methods. The existing inorganic and organic pollutant status and the ecotoxicological potential of the Spittelwasser floodplain near Je ss nitz was documented by analysing several element and compound depth profiles of a typical alluvial soil site. Geo-chemical analyses were performed on solid material and soil solution according to standard procedures. In laboratory experiments monoliths were continuously irrigated with deionised water and the leachate was analysed weekly. In addition to the geochemical, the ecotoxicological status of the samples was studied using different biotests for the dissolved and the solid phase.Results. The measured alluvial soil profile is severely contaminated with numerous inorganic and organic pollutants. Highest enrichment factors according to the catchment based, element specific geological background were found for Hg (402), Pb (8.9), Cr (7.1) and Cd (6.3). Assessment was made of the hazard potential of both the solid material and the soil solution according to the German Federal Soil Protection and Contaminated Sites Ordinance (BBodSchV). Relating to the respective maximum contents in the soil profile, the overstepping of BBodSchV trigger values is highest for Hg with a coefficient of 49.0 followed by Cd (14.3), Pb (12.2), Zn (7.3), Cr (5.9) and Cu (3.6). Pollutant concentrations in the soil solution exceed the threshold values for Cd, Cu and Zn by factors of 6.3 to 12. While DDT is retained in the topsoil, there is a considerable translocation of HCH towards deeper horizons. Discussion. The algae test confirms a strong toxicity in the top layer of the soil profile. In contrast, no such toxic reactions were indicated by the luminescent bacteria test and the Dapbnia test at this depth. However, the deeper layers (10-100 cm) show a toxic reaction by the Dapbnia test, thus indicating a relevant translocation of contaminants.Conclusions and Perspectives. The Spittelwasser floodplain represents a significant sink for inorganic and persistent organic pollutants. Simultaneously, the area is a relevant secondary source of dissolving contaminants like heavy metals and HCH. Although strict criteria in the lines of evidence for applying MNA are not fulfilled, it can be stated that the alluvial soil offers a high natural retention potential for As, Hg, DDT, and PCDD/E These pollutants are firmly retained and are not found in the soil leachate. This meets the demands of the EC-WFD for pollutant retention close to their primary source. But for agricultural use and groundwater recharge the natural attenuation potential of the soils in the Spittelwasser area will not be sufficient to achieve acceptable conditions medium-term. The main problem for the dissemination of pollutants is not chemical stability but mechanical dispersion. This is particularly the case for PCDD/F, with concentrations of more than 10,000 ng/kg I-TEQ in the upper Spittelwasser soil layers.

J		Article		Occurrence of pests and stem rot on various oil crops		Narits, L. (Lea.Narits@jpbi.ee)									Agronomy Research		2006		4	Sp. Iss. SI	307-310	307	310	English						The purpose of this study was to find an oil crop with no serious problems with pests and diseases, making it suitable for organic farms.The spring oilseed rape is the most important oil crop in Estonia. Winter turnip rape and winter oilseed rape are alternatives to spring rape.In the present exploration the following were investigated: incidence of flea beetles, pollen beetles and cabbage seed weevils, and the number of blind stalks and infection of stem rot on spring oilseed rape, winter oilseed rape and winter turnip rape.In winter oilseed rape and winter turnip rape trials no pesticides and fungicides were used during the growing period, but there was a variant of seed treatment by 'Rapcol' (phurathiocarb + matalaxil + fludioxonil) in comparison with the non-treated variant. Spring oilseed rape trials were treated by 'Rapcol' before sowing and sprayed by 'Fastac' (alpha-cypermethrin) at the beginning of flowering (stage of development - 61).The following results were obtained: flea beetles appeared most on winter oilseed rape, least on winter turnip rape. Pollen beetles appeared most on spring oilseed rape, least on winter turnip rape. Most pods damaged by pollen beetles' larvae were found on winter oilseed rape, least on winter turnip rape. Damage by cabbage seed weevil was minimal in all the oil crop trials. Stem rot infection was high on spring oilseed rape, least on winter turnip rape.By the results of exploration it can be concluded that winter turnip rape had the lowest infection by pests and disease and therefore has good potential for sustainable agriculture.

J	12492921	Article		Using event trees to quantify pathogen levels on root crops from land application of treated sewage sludge.		Gale, P. (gale_p@wrcplc.co.uk)									Journal of Applied Microbiology		2003		94	1	35-47	35	47	English	print					Aims: To quantify the incremental exposure of root crops, at point of harvest, to enteric pathogens from sewage sludge applied to agricultural land according to current regulations and guidance (Safe Sludge Matrix). Methods and Results: A quantitative risk assessment based on the Source-Pathway-Receptor approach is developed for Cryptosporidium and salmonellas. Event trees are constructed to model the partitioning of pathogens present in raw sewage into sludge at the sewage treatment works and to model to the pathways by which root crops may be exposed to those pathogens after treatment and land application of the sludge. The main barriers are sewage sludge treatment, and decay and dilution of the pathogens in the soil. The exposures are expressed in terms of the arithmetic mean. This represents the total loading and accommodates fluctuations not only in the levels of pathogens present in sewage but also in the removal efficiencies by the various barriers. One source of uncertainty is the degree of by-pass of sludge treatment at operational scale. Conclusions: The models predict that land application of sewage sludge treated by conventional processes (achieving 2-log removal) increases the exposures of root crops to salmonellas and Cryptosporidium oocysts by counts of 0.070 and 0.033 kg-1, respectively. These predictions are based on decay periods in the soil of 5 and 12 weeks, respectively, and are therefore worst case in not allowing for the full extent of no harvesting periods. A Monte Carlo simulation predicts that 0.01% of 1-kg batches contained > 50 salmonellas and demonstrates that, for risk assessment, it is acceptable to use the arithmetic mean exposure directly in the dose-response curve. Significance and Impact of the Study: The predicted numbers of pathogens on root crops at point of harvest provide a basis for modelling the excess risks to humans consuming such crops. The approach underpins scientifically the Safe Sludge Matrix.

J		Article		Controlling aphids in iceberg lettuce by alarm pheromone in combination with an insecticide		Ester, A.; Gut, J.; Van Oosten, A. M.; Pijnenburg, H. C. H.									Journal of Applied Entomology		1993		115	5	432-440	432	440	English						Field experiments were carried out between 1987-1989 at a location with extremely high population densities of aphids. The performances of pirimicarb, pyrethrum, dichlorvos, cycloprothrin in combination with an alarm pheromone were compared with commercial dosages of the insecticides to control the aphids in iceberg lettuce. After planting, various doses and spray intervals were applied to control the aphids. A spray application of carbamate or organic phosphate at one-tenth of the recommended dose in combination with the pheromone was successful in controlling the aphids. The farnesene formulation appears to have an alarm effect on aphids as well as hormonal and mortality effects.	Ester, A.; Res. Stn. Arable Farming Field Production Vegetables, P.O.

A postal questionnaire was completed by 427 patients and 427 controls. We obtained genotyping data on isolates from 191 patients; 115 were Cryptosporidium hominis, and 76 were C. parvum. When all cryptosporidiosis cases were analyzed, three variables were strongly associated with illness: travel outside the United Kingdom, contact with another person with diarrhea, and touching cattle. Eating ice cream and eating raw vegetables were both strongly negatively associated with illness. Helping a child <5 years of age to use the toilet and the number of glasses of tap water drunk at home each day were also independently positively associated with risk. Eating tomatoes was negatively associated. For C. hominis infections, the strongly significant risk factors were travel abroad and changing diapers of children <5 years of age. For C. parvum, eating raw vegetables and eating tomatoes were strongly negatively associated with illness; touching farm animals was associated with illness.

This method shows good results not only under normal conditions, but also on problematic sites such as steep slopes and in subalpine areas. With the exception of fertilizers, no synthetic components, e.g. bitumen emulsions or soil-fixing adhesives are needed. Biennial varieties of rye (Secale cereale L.) and sometimes vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) are used as cover plants, which produce a lot of organic matter above and below ground. These rapidly growing cover plants prevent surface erosion and protect the slowly growing perennial revegetation plants. After 2 years, the rotting shoots and roots form a green manure, which is important for soil microorganisms. Biennial cover plants, perennial revegetation plants and fertilizer are applied together. On steep terrain small ditches (furrows), running diagonally across the slope, are dug or hoed by hand to control surface runoff and prevent surface erosion and the formation of rills and gullies. This method has proved to be cheap and effective and has the advantage of mostly using natural material.

Preventive Veterinary Medicine		2000	April 28, 2000	44	3-4	153-165	153	165	English	print					A prospective longitudinal field study was conducted in the period from January 1994 to January 1996 to analyse the relationship between some selected risk factors in the growing and laying periods and (1) the flock-level occurrence of Marek's disease (MD) during the period from 16 to 32 weeks of age and (2) the cumulative mortality during the same period. A total of 171 layer flocks in 102 egg-production farms were included in the statistical analyses. A logistic regression (with strain of layer and vaccination program against MD as fixed effects) of flock-level MD-status during the first 16 weeks of the laying period was conducted. Of the risk factors investigated, "multi-age management" and "housing system" were significantly associated at the rearing farm, and "number of hens in each cage" at the egg-production farm. Flocks kept in single-age facilities had a lower risk of MD than flocks housed in farms with multi-age management. The odds of MD were larger for flocks housed on a litter floor in the rearing farms compared to flocks housed in battery cages. At the egg-production stage, flocks kept in battery cages housing more than three hens were at greater risk of MD than those held in cages for three hens or less. A weighted least-squares regression (with strain of layer and flock-level MD-status as fixed effects) of cumulative mortality during the period from 16 to 32 weeks of age was also run. The same risk factors (with the same directions of effects) and "size of the rearing farm" were included in the final model of mortality. Chicks reared in medium-sized farms were at higher risk of dying than those coming from either small or large rearing farms. Our results confirm the importance of preventing chicks from being exposed to MD-virus during the rearing period, to reduce the risk of MD-outbreaks (and thereby, mortality losses) during the early stage of the egg-laying period.

J		Article		Identification of new endemic tick-borne encephalitis foci in Poland - a pilot seroprevalence study in selected regions		Stefanoff, Pawel (pstefanoff@pzh.gov.pl) ; Siennicka, Joanna; Kaba, Jaroslaw; Nowicki, Marius; Ferenczi, Emoke; Gut, Wlodzimierz									IJMM International Journal of Medical Microbiology		2008	SEP 2008	298	Suppl. 44	102-107	102	107	English						In Poland. large-scale serologic surveys carried out in 1965-1972 revealed regions of Poland with particularly high prevalences of antibodies against tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). The information provided by the routine surveillance of communicable diseases during 1970-2005 indicated, however, that the geographic distribution of the disease is limited to a few eastern and south-western regions of Poland (defined as endemic for the purpose of this study). In the present serologic survey, 1498 human serum samples collected in 1996-2005 were randomly selected from a serum bank, and 358 goat serum samples were collected from milk-producing farms in selected areas of Poland 2002-2006. Thirty-nine human samples were positive for anti-TBEV antibodies, with an overall seroprevalence of 2.6%. Seroprevalence in endemic provinces ranged from 0.8% to 4.3%, and seroprevalence in non-endemic provinces ranged from 1.9% to 4.3%. In endemic, compared to the non-endemic provinces, the highest seroprevalence was found in the age group > 60 years (7% vs. 1%) and in inhabitants of villages (3.9% vs. 1.8%). In non-endemic, compared to endemic provinces. the highest seroprevalence was detected in the age groups 30-39 years (5% vs. 2%) and 40-49 (4% vs. 0%), and in inhabitants of large towns inhabited by > 100,000 people (4.1 % vs. 2.5%). Out of 358 goat samples, 17 (4.7%) were positive for anti-TBEV antibodies. Seroprevalence in goats reached 14/151 (9.3%) in endemic, and 3/207 (1.4%) in non-endemic provinces. The present study indicates the possible existence of endemic foci in north-western provinces of Poland, in which barely any cases were reported during 1970-2005. The socio-demographic profile of seropositive subjects in non-endemic regions suggests that they might have been exposed to TBEV during travels to known endemic regions. This would mean, however, that they were missed by the surveillance system. A thorough review of diagnostic protocols in non-endemic regions and work towards an improvement of the TBE surveillance sensitivity is necessary. (c) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

This paper analyzes the benthic diatoms and the macroinvertebrates of streams in two islands (Sao Miguel and Santa Maria) of the Azorean archipelago. Differences were found between the epilithic diatom communities located upstream (forested areas) and down-stream (urban and agricultural) of the water's courses., The diatom-based indices revealed that 10 % of the sites presented a good/excellent state of conservation. The macroinvertebrates indices confirmed the generally poor ecological condition of these streams. However, these results must be interpreted with care due to the low biodiversity and heavy rainfall conditions in these island streams. The existence of these specialized conditions requires a different approach to correctly evaluate the ecological quality of the archipelago streams.

Revue des Sciences de l'Eau		2000		13	2	119-138	119	138	French	print					Rivers are sensitive and vulnerable ecosystems that may be disturbed or even distorted by human activities. The most important consequences are changes in quality or quantity of physical, chemical or biological water characteristics. The impacts of human activities are sometimes immense and last a very long time: extensive engineering projects, illegal polluted water outfalls, direct storm water outfalls, combined sewer overflows, and effluents from wastewater treatment plants treating domestic and connected industries might be listed, but this list is clearly not complete. With particular reference to wastewater treatment plant effluents, it is clear that such plants cannot get rid of the whole amount of pollutant loads from domestic and connected activities. The local pollutant pressure generated by wastewater treatment plants outfalls leads to physical, chemical and bacteriological pollution of the receiving fresh waters, potentially with great impact on the river system downstream. Studies downstream from wastewater treatment plant outfalls allow one to identify pollutant zones or pollution risks, and secondly provide a better understanding of the phenomena occurring in the receiving waters. Another goal of this work was to foster better environmental management practices; the conclusions are dedicated to the staff in charge of the SAGE "Schema d'Amenagement et de Gestion des Eaux" of the Mauldre river. A case study was undertaken on the river Mauldre and its tributaries, an environment under very high pollution stress. The river Mauldre is a small river in the Seine catchment. Its main stream flows from South to North and joins the Seine at Epone; the hydrological catchment area is 410 km2. The ecological and biological functioning of the river Mauldre has been highly affected by human activities for a very long time. The East part of the Mauldre catchment is mainly an urban and industrial area covered by big agglomerations such as Elancourt, Plaisir or Versailles, which are all located upstream from the right side tributaries. The West part of the catchment has a more agricultural aspect, with small villages and wide prairies or fields. To get rid of the water pollution loads from domestic and connected activities, twenty-three wastewater treatment plants have been built since 1950, with a total theoretical capacity of 440 999 population-equivalents. These stations treat most of the total pollution loads (88% BOD removal), but for phosphorus and nitrogen removal is less efficient (60% and 30%, respectively), since most of these stations are old and do not carry out very thorough treatments. The quality of the rivers is thus degraded by the anthropogenic pressure that is exerted on this catchment area. Impact studies on wastewater effluents are generally performed according to methods involving specific point analyses. We used two of these-calculation methods: the ratio of dilution and the rate of pollution. The first method calculates the river's dilution power according to the relation between the rate of low flow in the river and the average annual flow of the effluent from the upstream wastewater treatment plant (dimensionless). The second method, the rate of pollution or "Trabuc index", determines the wastewater treatment plant contribution to downstream water quality according to the formula: quantity of pollutant discharged in the treatment plant effluent/rate of low flow in the river (units = mgcntdotL-1). The application of the two calculation methods application does not give satisfactory results because they do not take into account the quality of the rivers or the quality of the wastewater treatment plant effluents. Furthermore, they ignore the river continuum by analysing successive point events. Both methods provide similar results: impacts of wastewater treatment plant effluents on the river are decreasing downstream. These results are discussed and compared with in situ river pollution measurements made especially for this work. The measurements show an increasing pollutant impact downstream, which contradicts the two calculation methods results used at the beginning of this study. Therefore we investigated the use of global methods, which take into account more of the river's phenomena, using our measurement results. First we developed a more satisfactory assessment of pollutant loads in the river and in the wastewater treatment effluents. The results of this revised calculation method are not far from our observed river data. They take also into account the quality of the wastewater treatment plant effluents. This method consists only of a one-dimensional basic model and gives a global description of river behaviour. This analysis was enhanced by a global assessment of the impacts, resulting from a systems approach. We refers our analysis to Joel de Rosnay's work, "Le macroscope" (DE ROSNAY, 1975). This approach involves the identification of structural and functional aspects of the studied system, using a new vocabulary: we talk of elements (river, water chemical elements, wastewater treatment plant, population, industries), frontiers (of the atmosphere, the hydrological or hydrogeological catchment) and internal or external links. The usual framework widens and the central question of this paper is considered in a broader context, the whole catchment and its components, furnishing brief answers. This method provides many points of view on our studied subject, and highlights new components and new relations among them. At the end of the study we discuss a very interesting relation between inhabitants of the catchment and low flow, which find expression in the population stress index. The wastewater treatment plant pressure on the river appears as an initial demographic pressure on the catchment. The last method we used needs fewer data than the others do, but give us a surprisingly accurate and highly significant index of the impact of wastewater treatment plant effluents.

J	15850957	Article		Bovine spongiform encephalopathy	L'encephalopathie spongiforme bovine	Baron, T. (t.baron@lyon.afssa.fr) ; Calavas, D.									Pathologie Biologie		2005	MAY 2005	53	4	229-236	229	236	French						The identification of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in human strongly reinforced the perception of risks associated with the infectious agent involved in Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE). The development of rapid tests for the diagnosis of BSE by the detection of the abnormal prion protein allowed a huge increase in surveillance of the cattle disease. This first revealed a higher prevalence of the infection than previously believed. However, food safety measures, mainly based on the ban of the use of meat and bone meal in ruminants and the elimination of specified risk materials from the food chain, already allowed significant progress in the control of the cattle disease, especially in the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, the diagnosis can still not be obtained in the live animal, while the disease only appears following a several years incubation period. Another major issue is the identification of the BSE agent when it has been transmitted to another species. This question not only arises in veterinary medicine, with the major question of a possible infection of small ruminants by the BSE agent, but also in human in which the existence of other forms of the disease linked to the BSE agent but possibly differing from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease cannot be excluded.

J	12079127	Article		Design considerations for increased sedimentation in small wetlands treating agricultural runoff		Braskerud, B. C.									Water Science and Technology		2002		45	9	77-85	77	85	English	print					Some suggestions to increase the sedimentation of non-point source pollution in small surface flow wetlands are presented. The recommendations are based on results from seven Norwegian constructed wetlands (CWs) after 3-7 years of investigation, and a literature review. The wetlands were located in first and second order streams. Surface areas were 265-900 m2, corresponding to 0.03-0.4% of the watershed. Each CW had a volume proportional composite sampler in the inlet and outlet, in addition to sedimentation plates. The mean annual retention of soil particles, organic particles and phosphorus was 45-75%, 43-67% and 20-44%, respectively. Results showed that erosion and transportation processes in arable watersheds influenced the retention. Sedimentation was the most important retention process, and increased with runoff, because the input of larger aggregates increased. Retention of nitrogen did not follow the same pattern, and was only 3-15%. Making CWs shallow (0-0.5 m) can optimize sedimentation. The hydraulic efficiency can be increased by aquatic vegetation, large stones in the inlet, baffles and water-permeable, low dams. Vegetation makes it possible to utilize the positive effect of a short particle settling distance, by hindering resuspension of sediments under storm runoff conditions. As a result, the phosphorus retention in shallow CWs was twice that of deeper ponds.	Braskerud, B. C.; Jordforsk, Frederik A.

Aquaculture International		1997		5	4	301-314	301	314	English						In a large marine lagoon (Thau lagoon, southern France) with a shellfish farming dominant eutrophication, the macrophyte communities were sampled by six transects of three depths (1.5, 2.5 and 5 m) and their characteristics (species composition, diversity and biomass) were described in relation to environmental and sediment parameters. With increasing eutrophication (total inorganic nitrogen, 0.140-0.295 mg l-1; dissolved reactive phosphorus, 0.045-0.110 mg l-1; and N/P atomic ratio, 3-22), silt fraction and shell fragments in sediments increased (12-93 and 0-65% dry wt respectively). Different types of macrophytic communities could be defined in the shallow zone (1.5-2.5 m) corresponding to four main and successive stages of degradation. A pure eelgrass stand (Zostera marina and Z. noltii) and an eelgrass community colonized by macroalgae were observed in SW sites and could be distinguished by their sedimentary features. In sites (NE) more affected by eutrophication (fine-textured sediment), available incident light determined two main seaweed communities: an Ulva rigida community, outside the shellfish tables, and a Gracilaria bursa-pastoris community in the shellfish tables (lower incident light).

J		Article		Ecological responses of epilithic diatoms and aquatic macrophytes to fish farm pollution in a Spanish river	Respuestas ecologicas de las diatomeas epiliticas y macrofitos acuaticos a la contaminacion producida por una piscifactoria en un rio espanol	Camargo, Julio A. (julio.camargo@uah.es) ; Jimenez, Alma									Anales del Jardin Botanico de Madrid		2007	JUL-DEC 2007	64	2	213-219	213	219	English						We examined the ecological responses of epilithic diatoms and aquatic macrophytes to organic pollution and nutrient enrichment caused by a trout farm effluent in the upper Tajuna River (Guadalajara, Spain). Four sampling sites were selected over the study area: one site (S-1) placed upstream from the trout farm was used as a reference station,, sampling sites S-2, S-3 and S-4 were set, respectively, about 10, 100 and 1000 metres downriver of the trout farm outlet. The river bottom was mainly stony with cobbles and pebbles at S-1, S-3 and S-4, but at S-2 it was covered by a thick layer of organic sediment. Although some macrophyte species (Apium nodiflorum, Groenlandia densa) were either absent or fewer downstream of the farm, abundance (% coverage) and diversity (number of species) for the aquatic macrophyte community as a whole increased. In contrast, epilithic diatoms were completely absent at S-2, and some species (Diploneis parma, Fragilaria ulna, Gomphonema angustatum, Nitzschia dissipata) were also absent at S-3 and S-4. Indeed, diatom diversity (number of species) was lower at S-3 and S-4 than at S-1. However, diatom abundance (cells/cm(2)) was higher at S-3 and S-4 than at S-1. Biological indices for diatoms (IBD, TDI) indicated a better water quality at S-1 than at S-3 and SA with a clear tendency to improve with distance from the fish farm. In contrast, biological indices of macrophytes (IM, IVAM-G) indicated a similar water quality at S-1, S-3 and S-4, but with bad water quality at S-2. We conclude that epilithic diatoms may be more useful than aquatic macrophytes for biological monitoring of fish farm pollution in fluvial ecosystems. However, as historical and seasonal factors may be relevant to understanding the distribution, abundance and diversity of primary producers in running waters, further studies on long-term seasonal changes are needed to improve the use of macrophyte and diatom indices in assessing fish farm pollution.

J		Article	Literature Review	Should we fear the marketing of transgenic plants?		Laine, Eric; Haicour, Robert									Cahiers Agricultures		1998	Nov.-Dec., 1998	7	6	546-556	546	556	French	print					Transgenic plants are now widely cultivated, despite the fact that the first market release of such material (i.e. tomatoes) took place only 4 years ago in USA. Estimating the risks of cropping and consuming these plants is an essential prerequisite, as stressed in the Rio Summit on the Environment. Many risk assessments are thus conducted in countries that produce these genetic modified organisms (GMO). The main concern is the possible toxicity or allergenicity of molecules present as the result of transgene introductions. The same applies for every new phytosanitary product or food additive: toxicologic data are available, but the long-term effects of low-dose exposure are sometimes unpredictable. Allergenicity can be estimated by comparing physical data and sequences of the new proteins with those of known allergenic protein families. Public opinion is highly concerned about the risk of escape of genes providing resistance to antibiotics. Such escapes from plants to bacteria or fungi could occur in the soil or the digestive apparatus, although infrequently. However, these are not synthetic genes, as they were cloned from existing microorganisms and, for this reason, the occurrence for their transfer to pathogens generally did exist before introducing them into plants. Ecological hazards should also be considered, including one controversial point: will herbicide or insecticide resistance spread into wild relatives, thus giving rise to weed populations with increased weediness? If the genes code for total herbicide resistance, the main risk is losing the efficiency of this product. If pest resistance is encoded, weeds could acquire better fitness. This question now concerns oilseed rape (Brassica napus) in Europe, but will apply to other plants in the near future. Every case has to be considered separately as gene flow to weeds relies on sexual crossing ability and genome compatibility between cultivated plants and related weeds present in the environment. Other ecological hazards often mentioned are actually not specific to transgenics, such as the wide use of herbicides (as is already the case), selecting resistant pathogen populations, or creating new plant viruses by recombination (which can also occur when plants are infected by different viruses). Finally, economic problems could also arise when culturing transgenic plants. With features such as "ripen-on-demand", fruit production will be possible at low cost and far from their marketplace; conversely, plants that produce very specific pharmaceutical molecules and that are now cultivated in very restricted areas could be some day replaced by "gene pharming" using transgenics.

Journal of Phytopathology (Berlin)		2008	MAY 2008	156	5	297-303	297	303	English						We analysed symptoms, wood lesions and fungi associated with esca in mature organic vineyards in the Languedoc-Roussillon region. Most previous surveys concerning esca syndrome were conducted in conventionally managed vineyards in other regions. We first found that esca may be present at a very low level in vineyards that were not treated with sodium arsenite. Affected vines displayed three types of symptoms: leaves with interveinal necrosis, wilt of entire branches and these two symptoms in combination. During the 3-year survey, not all affected vines displayed symptoms every year and the same vine rarely displayed the same symptom or combination of symptoms in successive years. The incidence of esca appeared to be correlated with the percentage of vines that died during the survey but no correlation was found with either mortality before the survey or with the age of the vineyard. Observation of cross-sections of a total of 210 vines with esca symptoms and isolation of fungi from the wood lesions led to similar results to those obtained in conventionally managed vineyards. Four different lesions were identified: a white rot lesion, a brown lesion in a central position, a brown lesion in a sectorial position and a scattered black spotting in healthy wood. The most frequently observed fungal species were Fomitiporia mediterranea (Fom), Phaeomoniella chlamydospora, Phaeoacremonium aleophilum and Eutypa lata. The white rot lesion caused by Fom was generally accompanied by one or more other lesions in the same vine. Similarly, Fom was generally isolated with one or several other fungi. No relationship was detected between the expression of external symptoms and any specific lesion or fungus. Our study also showed that esca and Eutypa dieback are often superimposed in our region of sampling.

American Industrial Hygiene Association Journal		1995		56	8	804-808	804	808	English						A cross-sectional study of chicken catchers was carried out by personal sampling of air contaminants. The catchers used either the drawer method (DM) or truck method (TM) for loading chickens into cages. DM catchers were exposed to higher concentrations of hazardous substances than TM catchers, except for ammonia. In terms of geometric means total dust concentrations were 11.3 mg/m-3 (DM catchers) and 8.1 mg/m-3 (TM catchers). Full-shift dust exposure exceeded the Danish occupational exposure limit (OEL) of 3 mg/m-3 for organic dust by at least a factor of 2. From paired personal sampling data the concentration of respirable dust ranged from 18% to 28% of the total dust concentration. The average exposure level to bacterial endotoxin in total dust at 82 ng/m-3 for DM catchers and 42 ng/m-3 for TM catchers exceeded a limit of 10 ng/m-3 recommended for poultry processing industry workers in the United States. Endotoxin content of airborne dust averaged 6.5 +- 4.9 ng/mg. Exposure to microorganisms was determined by microscopy (total count) and by culturing (viable count). The geometric means for total count (microorganism/m-3) were 7.0 times 10-8 (DM catchers) and 4.9 times 10-8 (TM catchers) and for viable count 3.2 times 10-7 cfu/m-3 (DM catchers) and 1.4 times 10-7 cfu/m-3 (TM catchers). The ratio of microorganisms counted by microscopy to levels of viable microorganisms ranged from 5 to 200, implying a strong underestimation of exposure levels from viable counts alone. It was concluded that Danish chicken catchers were exposed beyond recommended limits for the air contaminants evaluated. Details in chicken-catching technique may affect exposure to air contaminants, and development of preventive measures is recommended.	Natl. Inst. Occup.

J		Article		Oligochaetes and water pollution in two deep Norwegian lakes		Milbrink, Goran									Hydrobiologia		1994		278	1-3	213-222	213	222	English						Analyses of the oligochaete fauna of two of the deepest lakes in Scandinavia - the Norwegian lakes Mjosa (450 m) and Tyrifjorden (295 m), revealed a totally different species composition in the deep profundal compared with the upper profundal - in contact with the nutrient-enriched epilimnion. In both lakes a pronounced thermal stratification develops in the summer, thus the epilimnion receiving gross organic pollution behaves differently from the profundal. The lakes are each effectively divided into two bodies of water with limited water exchange between them, i.e. one major oligotrophic body and one minor more nutrient-rich. Since the 1950s both lakes have been exposed to heavy pollution of various kinds. In Lake Mjosa in 1975 and 1976 unpleasant algal blooms of the blue-green alga Oscillatoria bornetii fa. tenuis occurred. Bottom samples obtained at the same time revealed that the deep central bottoms of the lake were totally dominated by oligotrophic oligochaete indicators, i.e. by Stylodrilus heringianus and Spirosperma ferox, while the fauna of the upper profundal in the vicinity of domestic and agricultural sewage outfalls, wood processing industries, etc. was dominated by Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri and Tubifex tubifex in great abundance, indicating enriched conditions. Several other species indicative of eutrophy, were absent, most of them belonging to the genus Potamothrix. A fairly similar situation exists in Lake Tyrifjorden, where, for instance, in the shallow bay of Steinsfjorden - heavily eutrophied by agricultural wastes - blooms of blue-green algae have caused problems from time to time. The same oligochaete communities as in Lake Mjosa distinguish the central oligotrophic bottoms from the regionally more enriched upper profundal. The likely reasons for an intact profundal oligochaete fauna are great volumes of oxygen-rich hypolimnic water of low temperature and a high bottom/lake surface area ratio.	Dep.

J	10844188	Article		To treat or not to treat: A proper use of hormones and antibiotics		Refsdal, A. O.									Animal Reproduction Science		2000	2 July, 2000	60-61	Special Issue	109-119	109	119	English	print					Hormones and antibiotics are important remedies in animal reproduction. Compared to other areas of application, hormones are probably more used than antibiotics. The quantities of hormones applied in cattle reproduction are largely dependent on whether these drugs are extensively used for pharmaceutical control of breeding or not. Diseased animals should be treated both from an animal welfare point of view and to restore their production capacity. The treatment should be based on an accurate diagnosis. Some of the treatment methods used in animal reproduction do not seem to be well documented. When using antibiotics, it should be known that an infectious agent is present which will be susceptible to therapy. The use of hormones and antibiotics to solve or mask managerial problems should be avoided. Ideally, fertility and health traits should be included in a breeding programme. Therefore, all diagnoses and treatments performed should be recorded and these data made available for breeding purposes. Manipulation of the breeding cycle by pharmaceutical means should not disturb the natural reproductive performance of animals being progeny tested. Animal health and fertility should be improved by selection and good management rather than by extensive use of hormones and antibiotics. Cases of inappropriate use of pharmaceutical preparations have created a general scepticism among people concerning the use of hormones and antibiotics in modern farming. Evidence of increasing resistance to antibiotics in bacteria infecting humans has focused on the role that anti-microbial drug use in food-producing animals plays in the emergence of resistant bacteria. There is also a concern about possible residues in animal products. Further, the consumers have a growing interest in animal health and animal welfare issues, and they have ethical concerns regarding the use of hormones and antibiotics, in particular, as performance enhancers. In Europe, the number of farmers growing organically cultivated foodstuffs is increasing, and according to the regulations for organic farming, the use of hormones and antibiotics is limited. Even though the proper use of hormones and antibiotics does not have any known negative effect on animal welfare or public health, the consumers' concerns have to be taken into account in livestock production.

J		Article		[Area-wide enzootic pneumonia and pleuropneumonia eradication: A sanitary project in pig production]	Flaechensanierung von EP und APP: Ein Gesundheitsprojekt in der Schweineproduktion	Zimmermann, W.; Masserey, Y.; Maurer, T.; Keller, H.									Tieraerztliche Umschau		2001	1 July, 2001	56	7	339-344	339	344	German	print					In 1996, a sanitary programme started in two different topographical regions of the Swiss midlands with a high density of pigs. The objective was the area-wide eradication of enzootic pneumonia (EP) and pleuropneumonia (APP). The two regions contained 50 communities and covered an area of 230 sq km containing 705 farm with a total of approximately 7,600 sows and 34,000 fatteners. The District Chief Veterinarians were responsible for the administration of the programme. Assistance with the enforcement of the measures was provided by the Swiss Pig Health Service. In the first stage, methods of diagnosis and surveillance measures were determined. In the second phase, detailed information was provided to farmers, veterinarians and the dealers. In a third phase, an overall evaluation of the results was performed on the pig farms. Initially the APP status was determined by serological testing and the eradication programme started based on these results. Breeding farms with APP were totally slaughtered. This involved only three farms, and on most breeding farms eradication was achieved through partial slaughter. All conventional fattening herds were totally slaughtered. The timing of the sanitary measures was fixed at mid-August. Acceptance of the programme by participants was remarkably high. In both regions, 19 EP and 3 APP cases of reinfection were recorded during a one year period of surveillance, these involved 10 breeding farms and 12 fattening farms. The reason for reinfection was not found for 4 (3 EP and 1 APP) herds. The majority of the reinfections occurred following the purchase of infected animals from a region outside the eradication area. The reinfection rate was, however, clearly reduced. A cost/benefit analysis showed that a herd eradication programme has a rapid pay back time.

E.; Panetta, V.; Pintor, C.; Matricardi, P. M.									Allergy (Oxford)		2005	MAY 2005	60	5	626-630	626	630	English						Background: Respiratory allergies are inversely related to early acquisition of food-borne and fecal-oral infections, consumption of unpasteurized milk, early exposure to stables and high endotoxin concentrations in a farming environment. We tested therefore if infection by Salmonella in early life can protect from development of respiratory allergies later in life.Methods: During 2003, we studied two groups of Sardinian children (age 6-18 years) who had been hospitalized before 4 years of age (during 1989-2001) with non-typhoid salmonellosis (n = 148) or acute enteritis of nonbacterial etiology (NB-enteritis) (n = 167). Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (AR) and asthma were evaluated by telephonic interview with a ISAAC questionnaire; participants reporting AR and/or asthma were further examined through a complete diagnostic work-up to objectively confirm or exclude current disease. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze the role of different types of enteritis on the risk of developing allergic rhinoconjunctivitis or asthma over time.Results: Children who had been hospitalized with salmonellosis had a lower prevalence of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (eight of 148, 5.4%vs 23 of 167, 13.8%; P = 0.019) or asthma (five of 148, 3.4%vs 21 of 167, 12.6%; P = 0.006) than those who had been hospitalized with NB-enteritis. The proportional hazard of salmonellosis for asthma was 0.23 (95% CI: 0.08-0.67; P < 0.01) and for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis was 0.40 (95% CI: 0.17-0.95; P = 0.04), after adjusting for confounders.Discussion: The strength of the observed associations suggests that Salmonella may contribute to shape the natural history of respiratory allergies. However, further studies are needed to test in other settings the association observed in Sardinian children. We speculate that clinical or subclinical infection by Salmonella may contribute to the atopy protective influence of a traditional farming environment or of areas endemic for food-borne and fecal-oral infections. Food hygiene and prevention of salmonellosis must remain however a public health priority.	Matricardi, P.

Fish and Shellfish Immunology		1998	Jan., 1998	8	1	37-47	37	47	English	print					Gilthead sea bream Sparus aurata reared in the Mediterranean area are affected, during cold periods, by a pathological condition termed 'winter syndrome'. This syndrome is causing significant losses in fish farms off the northeast coast of Spain. The histopathological study of affected fish revealed the presence of lesions in intestine, pancreas and white muscle. A survey of non-specific immune indicators (serum complement activity, erythrocyte agglutination, lysozyme activity, lymphocyte counts and oxygen radical production by macrophages) demonstrated a severe immunosuppression in fish samples in winter months, compared with those sampled during warmer periods of the year or after a period of recovery at higher temperature. No bacterial growth was detected from these fish. The observations are discussed in relation to water temperatures and to rearing conditions.	Tort, L.; Dpt. Biol. Cel. Fisiol., Fac.

J	14506875	Article	Literature Review	Plants and plant extracts for improving animal productivity.		Greathead, Henry (h.m.r.greathead@leeds.ac.uk)									Proceedings of the Nutrition Society		2003	May 2003	62	2	279-290	279	290	English	print					Plant secondary metabolites are a natural resource that is largely unexploited in 'conventional' animal production systems. They have in the past been generally considered as a source of anti-nutritional factors, and not as a source of exploitable performance-enhancing compounds. Recent and continuing changes to legislation controlling the use of animal feed additives have stimulated interest in bioactive secondary metabolites as alternative performance enhancers. They are broadly compatible with current thinking on the future of agriculture and food in Europe, and with consumer opinion. Interest has been largely on their manipulative role in the digestive and absorptive processes of the hindgut. The present paper will review the use of plants and their extracts to manipulate the rumen microbial ecosystem to improve the efficiency of rumen metabolism. The bioavailability of secondary metabolites and their actions on peripheral metabolism will be considered with a view to improving animal performance. The challenge of delivering plants and their extracts to animals outdoors in a controlled manner will be discussed. Much of what is known about the beneficial roles of plant secondary metabolites on animal performance is circumstantial and is based on tenuous data. In order to more fully exploit their bioactive properties for the benefit of animal performance, modes of action need to be understood. Uptake will be dependent on proven efficacy and consumer acceptance of assurances relating to safety, welfare and the environment.

J.; Niedan, V. W.									Chemosphere		2003	July 2003	52	2	339-354	339	354	English	print					Trichloroacetic acid (TCA), in former times used as a herbicide in agriculture, is now ubiquitous and almost evenly distributed in precipitations of the Northern and Southern Hemisphere, despite larger emissions of the possible precursors tetrachloroethene and 1,1,1-trichloroethane in the Northern Hemisphere. The permanent input of a herbicidal compound into most vulnerable ecosystems might lead to adverse effects to biota (plants, microorganisms, etc.). TCA soil levels of coniferous forests in mountainous regions of Central Europe are significantly elevated. Mass balance calculations show that precipitation as sole source of TCA in soil seems to be of minor importance and provide evidence for a natural formation of TCA within soil itself. In addition, the isolation of a chlorinating enzyme in soil and laboratory experiments with humic acid, iron and halide point to an omnipresent chlorinating capability of nature producing polyhalogenated organic compounds such as TCA. In this paper we present an overview of TCA levels in the environment and provide a new estimate about the extent of a natural TCA formation, especially in soil.	Schoeler, H.

J		Article		Phylogenetic relationships among Pleurotus species inferred from sequence data of PCR amplified ITS II region in ribosomal DNA		Bae, Shin-Churl; Seong, Ki-Young; Lee, Shin-Woo; Go, Seung-Joo; Eun, Moo-Young; Rhee, In-Koo									Korean Journal of Mycology		1996		24	2	155-165	155	165	English						This study was carried out to identify the phylogenetic relationship among several isolates of Pleurotus species by comparing ITS II region of ribosomal DNA(rDNA) repeat unit. Two primers from ribosomal DNA sequences were chosen to amplify the specific internal transcribed spacer (ITS) II region of Pleurotus spp. The exact ITS II region with an unique band from six species of Pleurotus genus could be amplified using the two primers taken from at the 3'-end of 5.8S rDNA and 5'-end of 28S rDNA. Six representative species of the Pleurotus genus were easily characterized according to the length differences of ITS II region. Furthermore, within P. ostreatus species, different sizes of ITS II region could be observed in the isolates of ASI 2025 and ASI 2095 although they were classified as P. ostreatus by the conventional observation. The nucleotide sequence analyses of PCR-amplified ITS II region indicated that the isolates ASI 2025 and ASI 2095 were different from other Pleurotus spp. When the nucleotide sequences of six Pleurotus species were compared, three typical ITS II regions were highly variable especially at both ends of this region. The phylogenetic tree obtained by the Neighbor program of Felsenstein PHYLIP package with all the nucleotide sequence of Pleurotus spp. indicated that P. ostreatus, P. florida, P. sajor-caju and P. eryngii were closely related to one phylogenetic branch and P. cystidious was related to other branch with P. cornucopiae. The isolates ASI 2025 and 2038, however, were not closely related to any other Pleurotus spp. and formed their own individual branches.	Bae, Shin-Churl; Molecular Genetics Div., Natl. Agric.

In the light of the zoonotic potential of Giardia infection, a total of 248 companion animals (167 dogs and 81 cats) were examined for giardiasis in the same urban area. The overall rates of infection in dogs and cats were 14.4% (24/167) and 22.2% (18/81), respectively. Significantly (p<0.05, p<0.01) higher infection rates were found in stray (18.7%) and farm (36.4%) dogs than in household pets (7.4%). Furthermore, the rate of infection was significantly (p<0.01) higher in domestic cats than in household dogs (22.2% vs. 7.4%). The owners and all 16 of their family members of five out of the six household pet dogs excreting Giardia were Giardia-negative, while both the owner of one dog and the only other family member were Giardia-positive. The data demonstrate that potential animal reservoirs (dogs and cats) exist in urban Serbia and underline the possibility of transmission between dog and man in close contact, thus having important implications for the epidemiology of giardiasis in urban areas.

The study group comprised 69 hop growers and 58 office workers as controls. The examination included: physician-administrated questionnaire, PEF measurements, skin prick test, agar-gel precipitation test, and migration inhibition test. Microbiological air sampling was performed on all farms. Results The concentrations of total airborne microflora ranged from 2.08 to 129.6 x 103 CFU/m3. Airborne endotoxin and dust concentrations ranged from 26 to 6250 ng/m3 and 0.2-31.7 mg/m3, respectively. Altogether 52.2% of farmers complained of work-related symptoms. Positive skin reactions to microbial allergens were significantly more frequent in a group of hop growers with work-related respiratory symptoms compared to the rest of the farmers (18% vs 2%, P < 0.05). Positive reactions in agar-gel precipitation test and in the leukocyte migration inhibition test were not correlated with the occurrence of work-related symptoms. The mean daily PEF values in farmers were lower compared to controls (469.7 +/- 127.5 vs 562.9 +/- 123.8; P < 0.001). PEF (amp%mean) was higher in farmers compared to controls (9.3% vs 8.1%; P < 0.05). Conclusion Despite relatively lower exposure to bioaerosols, compared to farmers in other branches of agriculture, over 50% of hop growers complained of work-related symptoms. This may be partly due to the effects of microbial allergens and toxins and partly to the irritant or allergic properties of hop plant itself. Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Revue Scientifique et Technique Office International des Epizooties		2003	April 2003	22	1	297-310	297	310	English	print					The authors describe the historic form of rendering and provide details on present-day practice. Possible future directions for the rendering industry are considered. The role of rendered meat-and-bone meal (MBM) as a dietary supplement in propagating the United Kingdom (UK) epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is discussed, together with the role of MBM in spreading BSE outside the UK. Evidence that customarily used rendering processes did not substantially inactivate the agents of BSE or scrapie is presented. In addition, the influence that the abandonment of solvent extraction (as an adjunct to rendering) in the UK might have had on BSE infectivity levels in MBM is discussed. The BSE-related safety of tallow and by-products of tallow are considered. Data that associate the BSE agent with a new variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, predominantly but not exclusively, in the UK, are also discussed.	Taylor, D.

Journal of Infectious Diseases		2001	15 December, 2001	184	12	1594-1597	1594	1597	English	print					Prevalence of antibody and risk factors to hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection were determined in a cross-sectional study of 2 group-matched populations: swine farmers (n=264) and persons without occupational exposure to swine (n=255) in Moldova, a country without reported cases of hepatitis E. The prevalence of HEV infection was higher among swine farmers than among the comparison group (51.1% vs. 24.7%; prevalence ratio, 2.07; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.62-2.64). In multivariate analysis, HEV infection was associated with an occupational history of cleaning barns or assisting sows at birth (odds ratio (OR), 2.46; 95% CI, 1.52-4.01), years of occupational exposure (OR, 1.04 per year; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07), and a history of drinking raw milk (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.08-2.40). HEV infection was not associated with civilian travel abroad or having piped water in the household. The increased prevalence of HEV infection among persons with occupational exposure to swine suggests animal-to-human transmission of this infection.

Modifications of water quality are well reflected by structural and functional changes of water biocenosis up to disparition of several species as a consequence of important physical and chemical changes of their biotops. The contribution of industry, zootechnical farma and waste water almost not epurated, is important for the disturbances registered first of all in the final part of the river sections crossing the district before they leave the country. This work presents comparatively the biocenotical structure the disturbances suffered of the six rivers in the border points, reflected by the saprobity zone (Knopp method) and the degree of purity (C%). Measurings were performed six time a year, in 1991-at six points (one of each river). The comparative studies were made considering as, parameters the saprobity zone, degree of purity and some bacteriological parameters resulting two distinct river categories: 1. not very polluted rivers: a moderate impurification, high values of betamezosaprobe bioindicators, stable biocenoses, a degree of purity with average value of 65%, average values of total number of germs about 10-4. Here can be mentioned the Timis, Moravita, and Birzava rivers. 2. very polluted rivers: highly impurificated, a great amount of organic matter, lower concentrations of oxygen, the main bioindicators are the polysaprobe ones.

Grall, Sophie; Manceau, Charles (manceau@angers.inra.fr)									Applied and Environmental Microbiology		2003	April 2003	69	4	1904-1912	1904	1912	English	print					The dynamics of Xylophilus ampelinus were studied in Vitis vinifera cv. Ugni blanc using gfp-marked bacterial strains to evaluate the relative importance of epiphytic and endophytic phases of plant colonization in disease development. Currently, bacterial necrosis of grapevine is of economic importance in vineyards in three regions in France: the Cognac, Armagnac, and Die areas. This disease is responsible for progressive destruction of vine shoots, leading to their death. We constructed gfp-marked strains of the CFBP2098 strain of X. ampelinus for histological studies. We studied the colonization of young plants of V. vinifera cv. Ugni blanc by X. ampelinus after three types of artificial contamination in a growth chamber and in a greenhouse. (i) After wounding of the stem and inoculation, the bacteria progressed down to the crown through the xylem vessels, where they organized into biofilms. (ii) When the bacteria were forced into woody cuttings, they rarely colonized the emerging plantlets. Xylem vessels could play a key role in the multiplication and conservation of the bacteria, rather than being a route for plant colonization. (iii) When bacterial suspensions were sprayed onto the plants, bacteria progressed in two directions: both in emerging organs and down to the crown, thus displaying the importance of epiphytic colonization in disease development.

(r.p.evershed@bristol.ac.uk)									Holocene		2008	SEP 2008	18	6	991-1002	991	1002	English						The disappearance of the previously abundant moss species Sphagnum imbricatum has been investigated at Butterburn Flow, northern England, using organic geochemical, elemental, macrofossil, pollen and testate amoebae analyses. Variations in the assemblage of peat-forming plants were tracked using the macrofossil distributions as well as the relative chain lengths of n-alkanes and concentrations of 5-n-alkylresorcinols and triterpenols. No significant changes to the vegetation assemblage could be detected prior to the loss of S. imbricatum. Variations in water depth were reconstructed using a testate amoebae transfer function and inferred qualitatively using bulk elemental composition and biomarkers for changing redox conditions in the bog subsurface: the degree of isomerization in the C-31 hopanes, and the concentrations of bishomohopanol and archaeol. Pollen analysis reconstructed the landscape surrounding the mire and revealed evidence for human disturbance. The results suggest that bog surface wetness increased with the transition from Sphagnum imbricatum to Sphagnum magellanicum, but the increase was not large and S. imbricatum had previously survived similar periods of wetness. However, the loss of S. imbricatum coincides with increasing human disturbance surrounding the bog, which may have altered nutrient inputs to the bog surface from agriculturally derived dust, to the detriment of S. imbricatum but to the benefit of S. magellanicum and Eriophorum vaginatum. It is proposed here that the stresses imposed by the combination of changing nutrient inputs and a rapidly rising water-table drove the disappearance of S. imbricatum from Butterburn Flow at c. cal. AD 1300.

J	15146987	Article	Literature Review	Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in Germany - Epidemiological data, development of risk areas and virus prevalence in field-collected ticks and in ticks removed from humans		Suss, Jochen (j.suess@bfr.bund.de) ; Schrader, Christina; Falk, Ulrich; Wohanka, Nikolaus									IJMM International Journal of Medical Microbiology		2004	April 2004	293	Suppl. 37	69-79	69	79	English	print					In Germany, 100 - 300 autochthonous clinical TBE cases have been recorded annually. There are high-risk areas in Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg and ongoing low-risk areas in Hesse, Thuringia, and the Rhineland-Palatinate and single cases in Saxony. In order to be able to evaluate the epidemiological changes described here, it must be mentioned that a new definition of TBE risk areas was introduced on the district level in 1998 in Germany and in 2001 with the new Infection Protection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz) which states that TBE is a notifiable disease. This led to the replacement of earlier surveillance systems and to many changes to data collection. In 1998 63 country and town districts were TBE risk areas, in 200179 and in 2002 86. There were new risk districts within Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg and outside these regions in Thuringia, Hesse and the Rhineland-Palatinate. An interesting trend was observed in TBE epidemiology. The TBE incidence in Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg has been stable on a high level for years; outside these areas it has steadily been climbing (Odenwald, Thuringia). On the basis of epidemiological data on TBE from the eastern part of Germany since 1960, it is obvious that major changes in virus activity in TBE risk areas also occurred in the past, the explanation of which has remained a matter for speculation. The epidemiological situation in the different risk areas for TBE in Germany was found to vary considerably, if one considers the surveillance data of the last 40 years. 1. Establishment of completely new low-risk areas. 2. Reactivation of formerly active areas with endemic latency. 3. High-risk areas with stable viral activity over long periods. 4. High-risk areas which have expanded and merged with low-risk areas. 5. High-risk areas which have developed into endemic areas or become inactive. High-risk TBE areas from 1960-1975 (i.e. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania) have since completely disappeared. There were, at the same time, high-risk areas in Thuringia which had only become latent and have now obviously become active again. The Odenwald demonstrated growing virus activity in the 1990s. These changes in TBE activity in German risk areas over more than the last 40 years are presented schematically. This ongoing number of risk areas is certainly linked to the notification obligation and greater public awareness. Nevertheless, any effects of ecological and climatic changes on the natural foci cannot be ruled out nor can changes in human leisure behaviour. Local weather conditions also have a major effect on the TBE incidence. Warm and dry summers may cause low tick activities, rainy summers may lead to low exposure rates of human beings. Even changes in forms of agricultural production prompted by different political structures probably have an impact as do economic constraints which may lead to lower vaccination and higher exposure rates. Regular, systematic virus prevalence measurements from 1997 to 2002 in field-collected ticks in German high-risk areas do not indicate any risk increase nor do they suggest a downward trend. Studies on virus prevalence in questing versus partially engorged ticks indicate that we neither exactly know nor understand the real quantitative relations between the virus and the host. In a first study, virus prevalence in Ixodes ricinus removed from humans was examined. Humans which were exposed in some districts near Passau in Bavaria. In the autumn of 2001, virus prevalence of unengorged free-living nymphs (n = 820) in this area was 0.38 (0.08-1.1)% and of adults (n = 90) 1.17 (0.03-6.38)%. Surprisingly, virus prevalence in partially engorged ticks from the same area collected during the same period was significantly higher (nymphs, n = 86, 6.9% and adults, n = 129, 9.3%). Virus-positive partially engorged ticks were only found in districts known as risk areas. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence data of the PCR products have confirmed the presence of virus prototype Neudoerfl only.

Immune activation may direct the immune response, thus conferring tolerance to allergens such as animal dander or tree and grass pollen. Methods Parents of children who were 6 to 13 years of age and were living in rural areas of Germany, Austria, or Switzerland where there were both farming and nonfarming households completed a standardized questionnaire on asthma and hay fever. Blood samples were obtained from the children and tested for atopic sensitization; peripheral-blood leukocytes were also harvested from the samples for testing. The levels of endotoxin in the bedding used by these children were examined in relation to clinical findings and to the cytokine-production profiles of peripheral-blood leukocytes that had been stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and staphylococcal enterotoxin B. Complete data were available for 812 children. Results Endotoxin levels in samples of dust from the child's mattress were inversely related to the occurrence of hay fever, atopic asthma, and atopic sensitization. Nonatopic wheeze was not significantly associated with the endotoxin level. Cytokine production by leukocytes (production of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon-gamma, interleukin-10, and interleukin-12) was inversely related to the endotoxin level in the bedding, indicating a marked down-regulation of immune responses in exposed children. Conclusions A subject's environmental exposure to endotoxin may have a crucial role in the development of tolerance to ubiquitous allergens found in natural environments.

J		Article		Modelling nitrogen, primary production and oxygen in a Mediterranean lagoon. Impact of oysters farming and inputs from the watershed		Chapelle, Annie; Menesguen, Alain; Deslous-Paoli, Jean-Marc; Souchu, Philippe; Mazouni, Nabila; Vaquer, Andre; Millet, Bertrand									Ecological Modelling		2000	March 30, 2000	127	2-3	161-181	161	181	English	print					An ecosystem model based on nitrogen cycling and oxygen has been developed for the Thau lagoon. It takes into account the specific features of this Mediterranean lagoon, a semi-confined system with watershed inputs and oyster farming. The ecosystem model uses currents calculated by a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model and integrated into a box model. This model is compared with a year survey data and used to estimate nitrogen and oxygen fluxes between the different ecosystem compartments. The yearly simulation shows that the ecosystem behavior is driven by meteorological forcing, especially rain which causes watershed inputs. These inputs trigger microphytoplankton growth, which is responsible for new primary production. During dry periods, nitrogen is recycled into the lagoon thanks to oysters excretion, sediment release, microzooplankton excretion and mineralization. Ammonium produced in this way is consumed by a population of pico- and nanophytoplankton causing regenerated primary production. Consequently, the ecosystem remains highly productive in summer even without external inputs. Shellfish farming also plays an important role in the whole lagoon through biodeposition. Driven by biodeposition, sediment release is the major source of nitrogen in the water column and causes oxygen reduction. The oysters contribute to the recycling activity by excretion, which supports the regenerated primary production. They are also involved in oxygen consumption by respiration which can cause local hypoxia. Further improvements are proposed before this model may become a functional environmental model for a lagoon ecosystem.

J	16740004	Article		Antimicrobial agents are societal drugs - How should this influence prescribing?		Sarkar, Paul (paulsarkar@hotmail.com) ; Gould, Ian M.									Drugs		2006		66	7	893-901	893	901	English						This paper is concerned with how those who prescribe antimicrobials should consider the wider repercussions of their actions. It is accepted that in an ecological system, pressure will cause evolution; this is also the case with antimicrobials, the result being the development of resistance and the therapeutic failure of drugs. To an extent, this can be ameliorated through advances by the pharmaceutical industry, but that should not stop us from critically appraising our use and modifying our behavior to slow this process down.Up to 50% of prescribing in human medicine and 80% in veterinary medicine and farming has been considered questionable. The Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antimicrobials (APUA) was approached by the WHO to review the situation. Their recommendations include decreasing the prescribing of antibacterials for nonbacterial infections. In the UK, there has been an initiative called 'the path of least resistance'. This encourages general practitioners to avoid prescribing or reduce the duration of prescriptions for conditions such as upper respiratory tract infections and uncomplicated urinary tract infections; this approach has been successful. Another recommendation is to reduce the prescribing of broad-spectrum antibacterials. In UK hospitals, the problems identified with the inappropriate use of antibacterials are insufficient training in infectious disease, difficulty in selecting empirical antibacterial therapy, poor use of available microbiological information, the fear of litigation and the fact that the majority of antibacterials are prescribed by the least experienced doctors. With close liaison between the laboratories and clinicians, and the development of local protocols, this can be addressed. Another recommendation is to tighten the use of antibacterial prophylaxis and to improve patient compliance. Through a combination of improved education for doctors and patients, and improved communication skills, these problems can be addressed. A further recommendation is to encourage teaching methods that modify prescribing habits. It has been shown that workshops have led to a significant reduction in the prescribing of broad-spectrum antibacterials in the community. Auditing the prescribing of antibacterials has also been recommended.Surveillance systems around the world monitor trends in resistance: the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Programme (EARSS) monitors antibacterial resistance; the WHO and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease collaborate to monitor tuberculosis; the WHO and the International AIDS Society monitor HIV.In the third world, a bigger problem than resistance is whether drugs are even effective, as they are often spoiled by climactic conditions, and poor quality generics and counterfeit drugs are common. Also, patients may not be able to complete a course for financial reasons.Facts about Antimicrobial resistance in Animals (and agriculture) and Impact on Resistance (FAAIR) was commissioned by APUA. They conclude that the nonhuman use of antibacterials can lead to the development of antibacterial resistance in human pathogens. The European commission banned the use of antibacterials as growth promoters in 1999.In the Western world, we should improve our diagnosis of sepsis, access local guidelines and consider withholding treatment pending investigations, decide if treatment can be stopped earlier and treat the patient not the result. Many developing countries need improved access to more antimicrobials, preferably in the controlled environment of appropriate medical advice.

The occurrence of microscopic fungi in surface water was used to determine the sources and a level of stream contamination. This group of fungi is of hygienic and ecological importance. Water of the Cabaj stream had continually been polluted by soil organic substances during the whole experimental period. Difficult degradable substances caused the pollution of water only in the second experimental period (from March 2000 to Feb. 2001). This influence was significant only with respect to samplings but not to the sampling points. There was a slight linear correlation between the occurrence of microscopic fungi and temperature of water, depth of stream and precipitation. Thirty one species of soil microscopic fungi were identified in the water of the Cabaj stream. The following representatives of the soil fungi were the most frequent with maximum values: Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium sp., Trichoderma sp., Humicola sp. and Cladosporium sp.

Journal of Applied Microbiology		2007	MAR 2007	102	3	667-673	667	673	English						Aims: To distinguish Italian Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) water buffalo Mozzarella from different producers on a molecular basis in relation to the place of manufacturing within the production district, and to develop a tool for genetic traceability of typical dairy products.Methods and Results: Microbial DNA was isolated from Mozzarella's governing liquid to amplify the whole microflora's ribosomal 16S-23S internal transcribed spacers (ITS)-PCR fingerprinting by means of an original primer pair. Phylogenetic distance analyses were performed on the obtained electrophoretic band patterns by maximum parsimony and neighbour-joining tree construction algorithms for discrete binary data, using a conventional bootstrap resampling test. The observed band profiles showed high repeatability and specificity, allowing unambiguous distinction of each sample; phylogenetic analyses yielded the same tree topology with good strength of nodal support. Moreover, a relationship between the genetic distances among samples and the actual geographical ones separating the respective producing dairies was observed.Conclusions: The genetic diversity of PDO water buffalo Mozzarella's microflora, observed by ITS-PCR fingerprinting, can be exploited to discriminate cheeses from differently located dairies.Significance and Impact of the Study: Given the increasing importance of food traceability for safety, quality and typicalness issues, the ITS-PCR fingerprinting protocol described here may represent a suitable tool for tracing the geographical origin of Italian Mozzarella.

J		Article		High tolerance of European plum varieties to plum leptonecrosis		Carraro, Luigi; Loi, Nazia; Ermacora, Paolo; Osler, Ruggero									European Journal of Plant Pathology		1998	March, 1998	104	2	141-145	141	145	English	print					A 13 year comparative study was carried out on the behaviour of four European and two Japanese plum varieties grown in adjacent rows in an area of northern Italy where plum leptonecrosis is epidemic. Within seven years, 100% of the Japanese plum trees became symptomatically infected. Nine years after planting, five trees of each of the European cvs, which were asymptomatic, were top-grafted with healthy buds of the cv Ozark Premier, which is an indicator for plum leptonecrosis. Based on the results of PCR analysis, DAPI staining and on the reaction of the top-grafted Ozark Premier indicators, 50% of the European plum trees, despite their healthy appearance, were shown to be infected with plum leptonecrosis. The detectable presence and graft transmissibility of the plum leptonecrosis phytoplasma in the asymptomatic European plum trees means that the European plum trees are not resistant to the infection but that they are tolerant. The active presence of a still unknown vector/s in the investigated area is stressed as well as the important role of Prunus domestica L. played in the conservation and spread of plum leptonecrosis.

J		Article		Strategy to reduce pharmaceuticals in drinking water - Technical approach	Wassertechnische Strategien zur Reduzierung der Trinkwasserbelastung durch Arzneimittelwirkstoffe	Puettmann, Wilhelm (puettmann@iau.uni-frankfurt.de) ; Keil, Florian; Oehlmann, Joerg; Schulte-Oehlmann, Ulrike									Umweltwissenschaften und Schadstoff-Forschung		2008	SEP 2008	20	3	209-226	209	226	German						Results The available research results concerning the application of innovative methods of wastewater and drinking water purification to eliminate pharmaceuticals are Summarized in the present paper. An increase of the activated Sludge (aerobic sludge) age to 8-10 days in treatment plants call improve the metabolization of less persistent pharmaceutical agents whereas expansion of the Sojourn time beyond 10 days will not result in a remarked increase of degradation for most pharmaceutical substances. First results have shown that wastewater treatment plants with integrated membrane bioreactors (MBR) using micro- and ultrafiltration membranes do not provide significantly better results compared to the conventional wastewater treatment plants with respect to the removal of organic micropollutants (including pharmaceutical residues). The use of powdered carbon in biologically treated wastewater is able to reduce pharmaceutical residues up to 80% in the run-off water. Pilot studies scrutinize the treatment of highly contaminated effluents via catalytic photooxidation. Regarding the Suitability of the method to reduce the contamination of drinking and wastewater with pharmaceuticals yet only few data from laboratory scale testing are available. Activated carbon filtration is preferably used for drinking water treatment. Primarily against the background of disinfection, ozonation is widely used for drinking water treatment, but for wastewater treatment the method is still at the experimental stage and will hardly become of practical importance because of high Costs. Sustainable wastewater separation is grounded on decentralized concepts by considering material cycles (recycling) at the place of origin. In the long term, separation measures can significantly contribute to declining drug concentrations in drinking water. Regarding the quarrying of drinking water by bank filtration water, river water or artificially enriched ground water, end-of-pipe techniques are vital. Most commonly, activated carbon or activated carbon combined with ozonization is applied and assures a high drinking water quality.Discussion The advantages and disadvantages of the different water treatment methods mainly concern the varying degrees of effectiveness with respect to the elimination of very persistent pharmaceutical agents, the generation of problematical metabolites and additional waste materials, hygienic problems, energy needs and the necessity to employ appropriate technical staff for operation. Although the biodegradation of very persistent drugs cannot be enhanced by an extension of the activated sludge age, this modification should be considered in sewage plants to reduce the contamination with less persistent medical agents. Compared with conventional wastewater treatment, membrane bioreactors provide the advantage of a better control of biological active-investment and operation costs. Additionally, pharmaceuticals Such as carbamazepin are only insufficiently removed from wastewater by membrane bioreactors. The regular use of powdered activated carbon in sewage treatment plants Would also increase the costs of wastewater treatment and would additionally exclude the further use of sewage sludge in agriculture. Currently, in Germany the further use of sew-age sludge is handled differently by the Federal States and discussed controversially. The implementation of ozonation as all additional treatment method in wastewater treatment plants is not realistic because of cost concerns. Additionally, the method produces analytically as yet not assessed metabolites with unknown (eco-)toxicological impacts. For this reason ozonation should currently not be applied unless the reaction products are removed subsequently by filtration through activated carbon. For industrial sewage photooxidation is in a state of testing but an application for Municipal wastewater is, up to now, out of question.When river bank filtration is used for the Supply of drinking water the use of activated carbon for purification should be essential. The lifetime of the filters is often defined by the filter capacities to eliminate radiocontrast media (e.g., iopamidole, amidotrizoic acid). Many water Supply companies already apply the ozonization prior to activated carbon filtration which Supports the elimination of pharmaceuticals from the sewage.The unique developmental potential of the wastewater separation can be seen in the possibility to link Lip these methods with sustainable exploitation techniques and concepts (re-use of sanitized water, production of fertilizer, compost and biogas). Wastewater separation will not make 'middle/end-of-pipe' techniques dispensable but will make their handling more effective because concentrations of pharmaceutical agents are higher in separated effluents compared to those usually found in municipal wastewater, which in mixing sewage systems is even diluted by Surface runoff.Conclusions Following today's state of knowledge activated carbon filtration (eventually Coupled with ozonization) is best suited to remove drug residues and other xenobiotics from raw water. Water works that do not apply the activated carbon filtration technique for cleanup of bank filtration water Should consider an upgrade. The ozonization is primarily required for disinfection of the water. As no acute health hazard proceeds from drinking water contamination by pharmaceuticals at the present time, the upgrade of wastewater treatment plants by one of the aforementioned innovative methods is currently not required in view of drinking water quality. This offers the opportunity to develop sustainable approaches that already aim to reduce drug contaminations of wastewater and hence of ground-, surface- and drinking water.Recommendations and perspectives On a short- to mid-term perspective enriched sewage of hospitals, nursing homes and other medical facilities should be collected and treated separately. From a technical point of view the conditioning of separated hospital effluents (yellow- and greywater) via activated carbon or membrane filtration is possible but should be combined with disinfection. On a mid-and long-term scale Sustainable sanitary concepts based on wastewater separation (black-, grey- and/or rainwater) associated with the recycling of mineral nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium) should be realized for development, industry and trade areas, buildings with public lavatories, airports, motorway service areas, and large office and hotel buildings.Strategies focusing primarily on up-grading of municipal wastewater treatment plants are currently existing but the related technologies are largely in a test phase. This is why a particular technique should not be favored at the moment. The combination of various techniques (i.e., ozonization combined with activated carbon filtration) is known to be very efficient for the removal of pharmaceutical residues from water, but the combination cannot be expected to become of importance in treatment of domestic wastewater because of high costs. Moreover, improvement of wastewater treatment technologies to remove pharmaceutical residues will not make the employment of end-of-pipe techniques in water works redundant and therefore will not lead to saving of expenses.

Diseases of Aquatic Organisms		1996		24	3	159-167	159	167	English						Cytoplasmic inclusions, ranging in size from 0.3 to 1 mu-m, were found in circulating erythrocytes of diseased turbot Scophthalmus maximus (L.), reared on several farms in Galicia (NW Spain). Examination of the erythrocytes with electron microscopy showed virus-like particles within cytoplasmic membrane-bound vacuoles, at the cell membrane or extracellularly. The particles, oval to spherical in shape, displayed a wide range of sizes, from 50 to 160 nm. Particles appeared to be formed at the cell membrane and were released by budding. In negatively stained preparations surface projections or spikes were recognizable on the external envelope. Virological studies carried out in affected turbot allowed the isolation of an enveloped RNA virus from the internal organs. Healthy turbot were infected intraperitoneally with this viral agent followed by observation of similar erythrocytic inclusions and virus-like particles 3 wk after infection. Erythrocytes obtained from healthy turbot were infected in vitro. Study of the sequence of morphologic events after virus infection revealed that 5 min after inoculation virus-like particles were observed within cytoplasmic vacuoles of erythrocytes. Virus-like particles were adsorbed to the cell surface after 30 min at 0 degree C but not internalized. However, at 4 and at 15 degree C the particles were endocytosed into small vesicles. After 2 to 3 d at 15 degree C, some erythrocytes showed irregular morphology and high electron-dense cytoplasmic areas as well as virus-like particles being released by budding at the cell membrane. The virus titrations showed that intracellular viral titres were almost constant along the experiment.

J	15131567	Article		Microbial exposure of rural school children, as assessed by levels of N-acetyl-muramic acid in mattress dust, and its association with respiratory health		van Strien, Robert Theodoor; Engel, Regina; Holst, Otto; Bufe, Albrecht; Eder, Waltraud; Waser, Marco; Braun-Fahrlander, Charlotte; Riedler, Josef; Nowak, Dennis; von Mutius, Erika (erika.von.mutius@med.uni-muenchen.de) ; G)ALEX Study Team									Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology		2004	May 2004	113	5	860-867	860	867	English	print					Background: Endotoxin exposure has been shown to be associated with a decreased prevalence of atopic sensitization and symptoms. Yet endotoxin represents only a part of the indoor microbial exposure. Muramic acid, a constituent of peptidoglycan, is present in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in the environment and may therefore serve as an additional marker of microbial exposure. Objective: To study the factors determining the level of indoor exposure to muramic acid/peptidoglycan, as well as its potential association with respiratory health. Methods: In 553 farm and nonfarm school children from Austria, Switzerland, and Germany, mattress dust muramic acid concentrations were determined, and health was assessed by using IgE measurements and questionnaire information. Results: The muramic acid concentration was found to be significantly higher in dust from farm children's mattresses than in dust from nonfarm children's mattresses (157 vs 131 ng/mg). Children with higher mattress dust muramic acid concentrations had a significantly lower prevalence of wheezing (odds ratio of highest vs lowest tertile of muramic acid concentration, 0.3; 95 % CI, 0.1-0.9), regardless of farming status and endotoxin exposure. The association for asthma was similar, and no association was found with atopic sensitization. Conclusion: Next to endotoxin, muramic acid provides us with an independent marker of microbial exposure. Unlike endotoxin, muramic acid was inversely associated with wheezing rather than with atopic sensitization.	von Mutius, Erika; Von Haunersche Kinderklin, Lindwurmstr 4, D-80337, Munich, Germany		riedler, josef/AAQ-4666-2020	von Mutius, Erika/0000-0002-8893-4515; Bufe, Albrecht/0000-0001-7335-9362	4	23		30	106	171			Immunology; Infectious Diseases; Pediatrics; Respiratory System	0091-6749		10.1016/j.jaci.2004.01.783		Clinical Immunology (Human Medicine, Medical Sciences); Infection; Pediatrics (Human Medicine, Medical Sciences); Pulmonary Medicine (Human Medicine, Medical Sciences)	10064, Biochemistry studies - Proteins, peptides and amino acids; 10068, Biochemistry studies - Carbohydrates; 16006, Respiratory system - Pathology; 25000, Pediatrics; 34502, Immunology - General and methods; 34508, Immunology - Immunopathology, tissue immunology; 35500, Allergy; 37052, Public health: epidemiology - Communicable diseases; 37054, Public health: epidemiology - Organic diseases and neoplasms; 37056, Public health: epidemiology - Miscellaneous	Primates, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Humans, Mammals, Primates, Vertebrates; Hominidae [86215]; [human; (child; patient)]	allergy; Hypersensitivity (MeSH); immune system disease/asthma; Asthma (MeSH); immune system disease, respiratory system disease; epidemiology	IgE; immunoglobulin E/N-acetyl-muramic acid/muramic acid/peptidoglycan			Austria; Europe; Palearctic region/Germany; Europe; Palearctic region/Switzerland; Europe; Palearctic region				farming, hygiene hypothesis, mattress dust, microbial exposure, respiratory health, rural school				2022-07-19	BCI:BCI200400292556

For a cropped plot (with winter wheat and 10 t cntdot ha-1 straw incorporation), N immobilization was of similar magnitude. Up to 18% of the applied 15N-fertilizer (185 kg N cntdot ha-1) were microbially immobilized. In contrast to 1988/89, no significant mass change of N-mic occurred in 1991 due to straw application ( simeq 10t cntdot alpha-1). Variations in the amount of N-mic were nearly independent on the treatment (crop, with 140 kg fertilizer-N cntdot ha-1 or without N-fertilizer, respectively; fallow plot without fertilizer-N) within a range of 225-400 kg N cntdot ha-1 cntdot 30 cm-1. Directly after N-application (each 70 kg N cntdot ha-1 in March and in May), up to 100% of the fertilizer-N were assimilated by the microbes. Subsequently, remobilization of the immobilized nitrogen occurred with 2 (in March) or 6 weeks (in May), respectively. Simultaneously, organic soil-N was mineralized after each N-application and minerally fixed for its biggest part. Between March and June, the fixed NH-4+ decreased by about 112 kg N cntdot ha-1 cntdot 30 cm-1.	Nieder, Rolf; Willenbockel, Astrid; Neugebauer, Elisabeth; Richter, Joerg; Inst.

Parasitology Research		2007	AUG 2007	101	Suppl. 1	S145-S152	S145	S152	English						In the genus Glardia (G.) intestinalis is the only species found in humans as well as in other mammals, including domestic and farm animals. Molecular characterisation of strains isolated from different hosts revealed the existence of seven major genotypic assemblages. Assemblage A and B isolates have been recovered from a broad range of hosts, including humans, livestock, cats, dogs, beavers and guinea pigs. Infection and subsequent cyst shedding contaminates the environment for all mammals, including humans. In this preliminary investigation we studied the prevalence of Giardia infection in kennel dogs from Hungary by microscopic examinations and using a G. intestinalis Agspecific coproantigen test. In order to investigate the genotypes of Giardia, a nested PCR specific for Giardia 18S-rDNA was introduced. All sequenced samples displayed the sequences described for Assemblage D and C dog-specific G. intestinalis strains. These results indicate, however, that dog giardiosis is highly prevalent in the studied geographical areas, but it doesn't present severe zoonotic potential. In the course of the study, the higher sensitivity of the coproantigen test compared to microscopy, and the significant decline in the infection rate with the increasing age of the dogs sampled was clearly pointed.

J		Article		Effects of the infection by the fungal endophyte Epichloe festucae in the growth and nutrient content of Festuca rubra		Zabalgogeazcoa, Inigo (izabalgo@usal.es) ; Ciudad, Antonia Garcia; Vazquez de Aldana, Beatriz R.; Criado, Balbino Garcia									European Journal of Agronomy		2006	MAY 2006	24	4	374-384	374	384	English						Festuca rubra,a commercially important turfgrass, is a common species in natural semiarid grasslands of western Spain. In natural populations of this grass, about 70% of the individuals are infected by the fungal endophyte Epichlo. Jestucae. In most cases, infected plants are asymptomatic. To test if there were differences in growth or nutrient content between infected (E+) and uninfected (E-) plants, five half-sib lines of F rubra were used. Each line consisted of E+ and E- individuals. These plants were used for a 5 years long field experiment in conditions typical of the surrounding semiarid grasslands. The soil was poor in nutrients, and rainfall was scarce in the spring and summer. No differences in biomass production or number of stems were observed between E+ and E- plants. Regarding nutrient content, E+ plants in vegetative state contained more phosphorus than E- plants. This effect was consistently observed in the 3 years that this type of tissue was analyzed. In one of these 3 years Mn content was lower in E+ plants than in their E- counterparts. In plants in a reproductive stage, differences between E+ and E- plants were found with respect to Ca, Mg, and Cu content. In this developmental stage, the contents of neutral detergent fiber and lignin were lower in infected plants, and their organic matter digestibility was greater. The evidence presented in this study shows that in field conditions, the content of certain nutrients, P in particular, and fiber constituents of F. rubra are altered when the plants are infected by the endophyte E. festucae. Since most nutrients were found in concentrations below the adequate range for plant growth, increased P content is a beneficial effect of E. festucae infection. This fact helps to explain why endophyte infection incidence is high in natural populations of F. rubra, and why the development of endophyte infected turfgrass cultivars may be useful for low maintenance lawns.

All the animals of the affected flock and all sheep in two flocks that were in contact were killed and buried. A systematic investigation of all available cases with signs indicating a neurological disease started in sheep and goats in late 1986, as well as in cattle in 1989. The investigation was based on clinical examination, necropsy or macroscopical examination of the brain and viscera, and histological examination of the brain in all animals except those with coenurosis. Histological examinations of specimens from the spinal cord and other tissues, and if considered necessary bacteriological, toxicological and serological examinations were also carried out. In October 1997, scrapic was diagnosed in sheep of a second flock (a mixed flock of sheep and goats), grazing in a pasture close to the place where scrapie was initially detected. All animals of the second flock were also killed and buried. Diagnosis in the first flock was based on clinical signs and histological lesions, and in the second immunoblotting was also used. Distinctive lesions of scrapie were found in the brain and/or the spinal cord of eight sheep with clinical signs from the two flocks. The lesions were revealed in the brain stem and/or in the cervical spinal cord, and tended to be symmetrical. In one sheep, severe lesions in the cortex of cerebral hemispheres and of the cerebellum were also found. In the brain of two sheep from the second flock the pathological isoform of PrP protein was detected. Despite the eradication scheme applied, scrapie in sheep reappeared after 11 years in a place close to where it occurred initially. This may indicate that the effectiveness of the eradication scheme implemented was not adequate and additional approaches may be needed.

H.; Esmat, Gamal; Fix, Alan									American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene		2002	October 2002	67	4 Supplement	436-442	436	442	English	print					Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is considered the most common etiology of chronic liver disease (CLD) in Egypt, where prevalence of antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) is apprx10-fold greater than in the United States and Europe. Reported are results that show the role of HCV in both overt and occult CLD, the risk factors for CLD and for HCV infection, and the relative importance of chronic HCV, hepatitis B, or both in causing hepatic morbidity. Case patients included 237 new outpatients at the National Liver Institute. Controls comprised 212 sex- and age-matched neighbors without liver disease. Case patients were more likely than controls to report a history of blood transfusions, schistosomiasis, or parenteral therapy for schistosomiasis; to have anti-HCV, HCV RNA, hepatitis B surface antigen, and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations; and to have abdominal ultrasound findings of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and splenomegaly. Anti-HCV-positive case patients were more likely than anti-HCV-negative patients to be male, older, and farmers; to have received a blood transfusion or parenteral therapy for schistosomiasis; to have ALT elevations; and to have ultrasound findings of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and spleen enlargement. Anti-HCV-positive controls were more likely than anti-HCV-negative controls to have received parenteral therapy for schistosomiasis. These data support the belief that HCV is the predominant cause of CLD in Egypt and suggest there is a large underlying reservoir of HCV-caused liver disease.	Strickland, G.

J		Article		Development of short-rotation willow coppice systems for environmental purposes in Sweden		Mirck, Jaconette; Isebrands, J. G.; Venwijst, Theo (Theo.Verwijst@lto.slu.se) ; Ledin, Stig									Biomass and Bioenergy		2005		28	2	219-228	219	228	English	print					During the last three decades, driving forces behind the development of short-rotation willow coppice (SRWC) in Sweden have been changing from a primary focus on biomass production towards emphasis on environmental applications. In most cases, current commercial SRWC practice is geared towards a combination of biomass production for energy purposes and environmental goals. The latter goals range from decreasing the impact of specific contaminants in the environment to organic waste handling in a recycling system in urban and/or agricultural areas. Where biomass production and pollutant management overlap, the science of phytoremediation has its practical application. Through phytoremediation, waste products that previously have been a burden for the society can be used as valuable resources to increase short-rotation willow biomass production. In this paper we will present the terminology and definitions of different types of phytoremediation.

J		Article		Evaluation of environmentally-friendly crop management systems based on very early sowing dates for winter oilseed rape in France.		Dejoux, Jean-Francois; Meynard, Jean-Marc (meynard@grignon.inra.fr) ; Reau, Raymond; Roche, Romain; Saulas, Patrick									Agronomie (Paris)		2003	December 2003	23	8	725-736	725	736	English	print					We assessed new crop management systems for winter oilseed rape based on very early sowing dates, with a view to improving environmental performance without decreasing economic benefits. In a network of 36 trials conducted over 3 years in France, the new systems turned out to be more effective than current systems in terms of environmental variables: absorption of almost all the mineral N present in the soil in autumn, even after organic manure spreading; nitrate concentration of the percolated water below 50 mgcntdotl-1, and lower levels of molluscicide use, even in years of heavy slug infestation. The gross margin was optimised by very early sowing, which in most trials resulted in yields equal to or greater than those for crops sown at the usual date. We typed the trials, linking the difference in yield between the two crop management systems to various limiting factors (crop establishment, stem canker and nitrogen nutrition), to identify situations appropriate for the new crop management systems.

J		Article	Literature Review	Phytoplankton in the Marsdiep at the end of the 20th century; 30 years monitoring biomass, primary production, and Phaeocystis blooms		Cadee, Gerhard C.; Hegeman, Jan									Journal of Sea Research		2002	October 2002 2002	48	2	97-110	97	110	English	print					Regular phytoplankton research in the Marsdiep started in the early 1970s as a curiosity-driven project fitting in the International Biological Programme (IBP). Interest was primarily in seasonal variation in species composition, biomass and primary production. Initially our monitoring was not intended to extend beyond the IBP programme, which ended in 1971. However, the example and support of Jan Beukema and the interesting links with his work on secondary production in the Wadden Sea were decisive in its continuation. As a result, we now have a time series of well over 30 years. We had the good luck to start in a period of relatively low phytoplankton values, whereas in the late 1970s biomass and primary production doubled in a short period. Duration of the Phaeocystis blooms, which regularly occur in spring and early summer in Dutch coastal waters, also increased. Light limitation plays a dominant role in turbid coastal waters. Our Secchi disc data up to 1985 did not indicate changes in turbidity, and therefore increases were seen as a eutrophication phenomenon. What would then be more natural than to expect phytoplankton to decrease again with the lowering of phosphate values in the 1980s and 1990s as a result of the successful cleaning of the Rhine? The data up to 1992 did not show any effect on phytoplankton of this deutrophication. Annual primary production during the period 1992-2000 decreased from a peak value of >400 gC m-2 in 1994 to ca. 250 now. Over the entire period 1974-2000, a slight increase in turbidity was observed. Phosphate concentrations have dropped a little further since 1992, but as could be expected, dissolved nitrogen (nitrate, nitrite and ammonia) and reactive silica did not show changes since the mid 1970s; inputs from freshwater and the atmosphere have not decreased. In accordance with the decrease of primary production, also chlorophyll-a and Phaeocystis cell numbers have dropped since 1994. These first signs of a decrease in phytoplankton parameters probably related to de-eutrophication make continuation of our Marsdiep monitoring highly interesting. No lengthening of the growing season of phytoplankton was observed comparable to that observed in terrestrial vegetation and related to global warming, but Phaeocystis growth seems to start earlier now. Our phytoplankton research covers only a small part of the period of man-induced changes of the Wadden Sea ecosystem, which started already in the Middle Ages. Certainly the recent overfishing of filter feeders such as cockles and mussels has affected phytoplankton, but also the cultivation of mussels and introduction of exotics such as Crassostrea gigas and Ensis directus must have influenced phytoplankton. The Marsdiep phytoplankton time series has proved to be useful in the continued ecosystem research in the western Wadden Sea. Continuation of this time series will also be helpful to study natural versus human-induced variations in this area.

J		Article		Influence of shellfish farming activities on the biogeochemical composition of the water column in Thau lagoon.		Souchu, Philippe (psouchu@ifremer.fr) ; Vaquer, Andre; Collos, Yves; Landrein, Sonia; Deslous-Paoli, Jean-Marc; Bibent, Bertrand									Marine Ecology Progress Series		2001	August 20, 2001	218		141-152	141	152	English	print					Thau lagoon is a Mediterranean shellfish ecosystem with large biomasses of oysters growing in waters with high residence time due to low tidal ranges. The influence of filter feeders (oysters and their epibiota) on the spatial distribution of particulate and dissolved compounds in the water column of Thau lagoon was studied through its variation with time. In 1991/1992, daily variations were investigated in pens, corridors and outside shellfish farming zones for nutrients, chlorophyll a and primary production. Salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients, organic matter and chlorophyll a were also monitored in surface waters inside and outside shellfish farming zones each week from January 1993 to March 1994. The presence of shellfish farms led to a decrease by only a few percent of oxygen concentrations in their vicinity, but the mean (+-SE) deficits of chlorophyll a and POC concentrations were 44 +- 4% and 26 +- 9% respectively in the eastern zone (8 m). The shift induced by filter feeders in phytoplankton composition favoured picophytoplankton with higher growth rates. But the summer increase in phytoplankton growth rate was stronger than the positive feedback due to filter feeder filtration. Summer was determinant for the growth of oysters owing to enhanced regenerated primary production. During this period, filter feeders were not food limited, while they tended to control phytoplankton biomasses and production the rest of the year. The nutrient excess in shellfish farming zones was highly significant, with increases of 73 +- 16, 36 +- 12 and 19 +- 8% for ammonia, phosphates and silicate respectively in the eastern zone. In the western zone, the nutrient excess was less strong by half for ammonia and phosphate, because the lower depth (4 m) allows light to reach the bottom and enables benthic macroflora to grow on nutrients of benthic origin. The decline of phytoplankton biomasses in shellfish farms induced a decrease in the nutrient demand, especially for ammonia. This situation was likely to favour nitrification, which led during autumn to higher nitrate concentrations within shellfish farming zones than outside. Therefore, filter feeders were able to alter the dominant biogeochemical process in the water column by stimulating nitrification.

J		Article		Public Health and Epidemiological Considerations For Avian Influenza Risk Mapping and Risk Assessment		Dudley, Joseph P.									Ecology and Society		2008	DEC 2008	13	2	Article No.: 21	21		English						Avian influenza viruses are now widely recognized as important threats to agricultural biosecurity and public health, and as the potential source for pandemic human influenza viruses. Human infections with avian influenza viruses have been reported from Asia (H5N1, H5N2, H9N2), Africa (H5N1, H10N7), Europe (H7N7, H7N3, H7N2), and North America (H7N3, H7N2, H11N9). Direct and indirect public health risks from avian influenzas are not restricted to the highly pathogenic H5N1 "bird flu" virus, and include low pathogenic as well as high pathogenic strains of other avian influenza virus subtypes, e. g., H1N1, H7N2, H7N3, H7N7, and H9N2. Research has shown that the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic was caused by an H1N1 influenza virus of avian origins, and during the past decade, fatal human disease and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed among persons infected with H5N1 and H7N7 avian influenza viruses. Our ability to accurately assess and map the potential economic and public health risks associated with avian influenza outbreaks is currently constrained by uncertainties regarding key aspects of the ecology and epidemiology of avian influenza viruses in birds and humans, and the mechanisms by which highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses are transmitted between and among wild birds, domestic poultry, mammals, and humans. Key factors needing further investigation from a risk management perspective include identification of the driving forces behind the emergence and persistence of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses within poultry populations, and a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms regulating transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses between industrial poultry farms and backyard poultry flocks. More information is needed regarding the extent to which migratory bird populations to contribute to the transnational and transcontinental spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, and the potential for wild bird populations to serve as reservoirs for highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. There are still uncertainties regarding the epidemiological and ecological mechanisms that regulate "spill-over" and "spill-back" transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses between poultry and wild bird populations, and the interspecies transmission of avian influenza from infected birds to humans and other species of mammals. Further investigations are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of poultry vaccination programs for the control and eradication of avian influenza in poultry populations at the national and regional level, and the effect of long term poultry vaccination programs on human public health risks from avian influenza viruses. There is a need to determine risk factors associated with the extent of direct human involvement in the spread and proliferation of avian influenza viruses through commercial supply chain and transportation networks, and specific risk factors associated with domestic and international trade in live poultry, captive wild birds, poultry food products, (meat, eggs), poultry by-products ( feathers, poultry meal), poultry manure, and poultry litter. Addressing these issues will greatly enhance our ability to implement economically and ecologically sustainable programs for the control of avian influenza outbreaks in wild and domesticated birds, increase our capability for promoting the protection of wild bird populations from disease and disruption, and help improve food security and public health in countries worldwide.

J		Meeting	Meeting Abstract	Bemisia tabaci biotype Q and its natural enemies in vegetable and ornamental crops		Arno, Judit (judit.arno@irta.es) ; Roig, J.; Gabarra, R.									Journal of Insect Science (Tucson)		2008	JAN 10 2008	8		5-6	5	6	English		4th International Bemisia Workshop/International Genomics Workshop	Duck Key, FL, USA	December 03 -08, 2006		Vegetables in some Mediterranean areas are grown mainly on small family operated farms. Vegetable crops are grown year-round in open fields and greenhouses built with metal frames, covered with plastic films, and mostly unheated. Vegetable production coexists with ornamental crops either in the open field or in heated greenhouses. In this situation, whiteflies reproduce all year with continuous carry-over among different crops and environments. For many years, Trialeurodes vaporariorum has been one of the main pests. However, from the early 90's, populations of Bemisia tabaci have been increasing in vegetable and ornamental crops. In the area of study, the northeast of Spain, tomato, cucumber and poinsettia crops are often heavily infested by B. tabaci. This pest usually coexists with T. vaporariorum and their relative abundance changes with crop and season. Tomato is grown in three different crop cycles from February to December in greenhouse and outdoors. Cucumber is grown mainly in greenhouses in two crop cycles from March to November. Finally, poinsettia is grown for the Christmas market in heated greenhouses from July to December. In tomato, biological control of whiteflies, by conservation and augmentation of native populations of the mirid bug Macrolophus caliginosus, is used by many growers. In cucumber, no specific biological control program is applied and, although the crop is sprayed more often that tomato, natural enemies can be preserved to a certain extent. In poinsettia, releases of the parasitoid Eretmocerus mundus to control B. tabaci populations together with the use of soft insecticides began in 2003 in few farms as an alternative to chemical control of the pest. In this scenario, we wanted to determine the importance of three B. tabaci sensitive crops (tomato, cucumber and poinsettia) on the survival of this whitefly, and to evaluate the natural enemies associated with B. tabaci and T. vaporariorum. For this purpose, tomato crops (IPM and non IPM) were surveyed: 9 in spring, and 7 in autumn 2003, and 11 in spring and 17 in autumn 2004. We also surveyed 7 cucumber greenhouses during September 2004, 7 poinsettia greenhouses during 2003 and 5 more during 2004. In these poinsettia greenhouses, growers released Er. mundus combined with the use of soft insecticides. Thirty tomato leaflets, 30 cucumber leaf-disks (9.6 cm(2)), and 30 poinsettia leaves were sampled to evaluate B. tabaci infestation, parasitization and predation. Parasitized pupae were isolated until the emergence of the parasitoid to determine its species. In tomato, Trialeurodes vaporarioum was the predominant species in the spring crops whereas B. tabaci was the most abundant in autumn crops. In cucumber and poinsettia, B. tabaci was almost the only whitefly present. In autumn 2004, although the infestation was very different among greenhouses, average density of B. tabaci on cucumber (3.43 nymphs/cm(2)) was significantly greater than on tomato (0.13 nymphs/cm2) or poinsettia (0.08 nymphs/cm2) (F=43.7; df 2,28; P < 0.000). These data showed that cucumber was the most important host where B. tabaci built up its population during autumn. Nevertheless, poinsettia allowed B. tabaci survivorship in cooler seasons because it was grown in heated greenhouses and could maintain whitefly populations until December. Parasitoids caused the greatest mortality of B. tabaci pupae in cucumber (average 18%), but their incidence in tomato was much lower (average 10%). Note that B.tabaci parasitoids had not been released neither in cucumber nor in tomato On the other hand, in poinsettia, Er. mundus was released in most of the greenhouses, and parasitism was substantial (average 56%). Encarsia pergandiella and Er. mundus were found parasitizing B. tabaci pupae (Table 1) with Er. mundus comprising 49 and 58 % of all parasitoids emerging from tomato and cucumber, respectively. Yet, in tomato and cucumber, both species were seldom found together in the same greenhouse (just in 2 out of 21 samples). In contrast, during 2004, both En.pergandiella and Er. mundus were found together in all the poinsettia greenhouses. Probably, the inoculation of Er. mundus in those greenhouses forced the coexistence of both parasitoids. Predator species differed in all 3 crops (Table 1). Predators were particularly important in tomato where M. caliginosus was the most abundant. In early tomato crops, where the B. tabaci population was very low, average predation reached 20 % of T. vaporariorum and 9% of B. tabaci nymphs. At the end of the season, percentages increased up to 34 and 46 % of T. vaporariorum of B. tabaci nymphs, respectively. In cucumber, average predation of nymphs was < 1%. This mortality factor was not evaluated in poinsettia due to the low numbers of whitefly predators detected in the crop. In summary, the use of biological control in early tomato crops, where T. vaporariorum was the main whitefly species, conserved and enhanced M. caliginosus and En. pergandiella populations. Later on, these natural enemies caused a great deal of mortality in B. tabaci populations in the autumn crops. To reduce overall B. tabaci populations in the area, biological control of B. tabaci should focus on cucumber, since this crop hosts the highest B. tabaci populations. The high natural parasitism rates that we found in some cucumber greenhouses suggest that parasitoid releases could avoid the build up of the pest in this crop. In poinsettia, releases of Er. mundus were effective in some greenhouses and reduced dramatically B. tabaci populations. However, it would be necessary to maintain the heating until the end of the crop to be able to sustain high levels of parasitism.

J		Article		The nutritive value of five pasture species occurring in the summer grazing ranges of the Pyrenees.		Marinas, A.; Garcia-Gonzalez, R.; Fondevila, M. (mfonde@posta.unizar.es)									Animal Science (Penicuik)		2003	June 2003	76	3 Cited May 16, 2003	461-469	461	469	English	online					Five species of alpine pasture plants from the Pyrenees representing 3 botanical groups: grasses (Festuca eskia, Nardus stricta), forbs (Anthyllis vulneraria, Galium verum) and shrubs (Echinospartum horridum), were collected monthly from June to September and analysed for nitrogen (N) content, cell wall composition, in vitro enzymatic digestibility (DMDe) and volume of gas produced by microbial fermentation. Among the dicotyledenous varieties, A. vulneraria and G. verum showed the highest nutritive value whilst that of E. horridum was low due to high lignin content. Grasses showed moderate nutritive values in June rapidly decreasing thereafter. Nitrogen content and organic matter digestibility (OMDg) of A. vulneraria remained relatively constant through the sampling period whereas it abruptly decreased for remaining species from July. Gas production significantly differed among species during the first 48 h of microbial fermentation but not at later stages of fermentation. Collection date did not affect gas production before 24 h of incubation but significant differences were found thereafter with samples from June and July being more degraded than from August and September. Principal component analysis associated OMDg positively with N content and gas production and negatively with fibre content. Lignin proportion did not significantly correlate with gas production or with OMDg, suggesting that the degree of lignification is not the only factor affecting microbial fermentation but other factors such as lignin tissue locations may be involved. A. vulneraria has been revealed as very good forage with a high potential in extensive animal production systems. Both OMDg and DMDe methods seem more accurate than chemical analyses for evaluating forages at different stages of maturity.

Constructed in 1929, it combines the production of hydroelectric power and the purification of pre-cleared municipal waste waters by farming carp Cyprinus carpio. For decades, the site has been a major moulting centre in Central Europe. In some years up to 100,000 waterbirds were estimated to have moulted their flight feathers between June and September, including threatened species like Red-crested Pochard Netta rufina (1000 to 3500) and a few Ferruginous Ducks Aythya nyroca. Following a great reduction of organic load and NH4 content in Ismaning waters, numbers of several species dropped dramatically, Pochard A. ferina decreased by as much as 91% compared to 1993. In April 1996, 3 of the 30 larger fishponds were left without carp, while the remaining 27 were stocked with 500 carps/ha as usual. From mid-June to the end of September the 3 carpless ponds attracted many more birds than the ponds with carp. In August, an average of more than 300 waterbirds per ha on carpless ponds contrasted sharply with about 10/ha on the fishponds. 7 out of 8 commoner species favoured the carpless ponds: Black-necked Grebe Podiceps nigricollis, Gadwall Anas strepera, Mallard A. platyrhynchos, Red-crested Pochard, Pochard, Tufted Duck Aythya fuligula, and Coot Fulica atra. It is suggested that they benefited from the abundant growth of macroinvertebrates and algae (Hydrodictyon and Cladophorales) found in the carpless ponds. The abandoning of carp farming in 3 ponds covering altogether 21 ha increased their capacity for moulting waterfowl by approximately 4,000 birds, including 2,400 Gadwall, 580 Pochard and 430 Tufted Ducks.

J		Article		Influence of the soil climate on the evolution of the nitrogenous compounds in the soils of Lorraine and their consequences on the water quality	Influence du pedoclimat sur l'evolution des composes azotes presents dans les sols Lorrains: Consequences sur la qualite des eaux	Cheloufi, Hamid; Jacquin, Fernand									Bulletin de l'Academie Lorraine des Sciences		2003		42	1-4	63-83	63	83	French	print					In order to establish the influence of the soil climate on the transfer mechanisms of the element N, under naturally constituted forms or industrial syntheses, in soil, water, plant systems, we put in place in the fields two procedures. The first concerned the cultivated sites of the four main types of soil found in Lorraine. The annual lixiviation of nitrates beyond the Ap level can be large and go beyond 100kg / ha of N.NO3-. It varies according to the soils, the year and the season and we observe that the nitrates are mainly lixiviated in autumn. The values obtained in-situ, compared to those of the potential mineralization in controlled conditions, show the importance of the interaction between climactic parameters and biophysical chemical properties of the soils intervening on the mineralization of the endogenous nitrogen stocks thus the risks of lixiviation notably between crops. Then on a light chalk/clay soil, the burying of a carbon substrate (hop) in end of season, allowed a limitation to the annual lixiviation of the nitrates of about 25%. The use of a fertilizer marked under controlled conditions, allowed us to see the formation of different sections of the internal cycle of the nitrogen and the bio availability of this fertilizer for a spring crop while allowing for the risks of enrichment in nitrate ions in the underlying waters. This study allowed us to establish the participation of the fertilizer in the possible risks of a pollution of nitrates to a level of 21%; also to underline the importance of the duration of the microbic biochemical immobilizations of fertilizers given to these four types of soils; finally, we observe a variety of the kinetic of remineralization from the newly-formed different organic azotes.					0	0		0	0	0			Chemistry; Agriculture; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences	0567-6576				Agrichemicals; Agronomy (Agriculture); Climatology (Environmental Sciences); Soil Science	07504, Ecology: environmental biology - Bioclimatology and biometeorology; 07506, Ecology: environmental biology - Plant; 10060, Biochemistry studies - General; 52502, Agronomy - Miscellaneous and mixed crops; 52801, Soil science - General and methods; 52807, Soil science - Fertility and applied studies	Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Angiospermae [25200]; [crop; (commercial species, crop)]		fertilizer; (bioavailability; agrichemical, fertilizer)/nitrates/nitrogen			Lorraine; France, Europe; Palearctic region				chalk-clay soil, lixiviation, microbial biochemical immobilization, mineralization, organic azotes, soil climate				2022-07-19	BCI:BCI200400443631
J		Article		Alternative additives for replacement of nutritive antibiotics for growing pigs		Valchev, G.; Zaprianova, I.; Marinova, P.; Zlatev, H.									Zhivotnov"dni Nauki		2003		40	3-4	33-35	33	35	Russian	print					An experiment was carried out with 153 growing pigs in total for the period from 6 to 20 kg live weight and divided into 3 groups (3 x 2 x 17) with the aim to determine the effect-of replacement of nutritive antibiotics (Flavophospholipol) in combine forages with the biological growth additive Demo Herb and with acidifier - Acid Lac, on growth characteristics and the health status of pigs. Vemo Herb is a new Bulgarian product that contains a biologically active complex of dry extracts from the following plants: Cichoria intybus, Cotinus coggygria, Tanacetum vulgare, in appropriate combination, and possesses adstringent activity on anti-bacterial basis and also a well expressed hepatoprotecting effect. Acid Lac Dry is a new generation acidifier: a combination of properly chosen organic acids with well expressed anti-bacterial effect. The results of the study showed that adding the biologically active plant additive Vemo Herb in a dose of 150 g/t in combined forages for started pigs led to significant increase of the average daily gain of pigs with 18% (P 0.01) and better forage utilization with 13% (P 0.05) in comparison to pigs receiving combined forage with participation of the nutritive antibiotic Flavophospholipol. Including the prebiotic Acid Lac in a dose of 0.3% in combined forages for growing pigs improved their growth with roughly 9% (P 0.05) and decreased forage consumption for one kg gain with 13% (P 0.05) compared to the control. Under the conditions of the present study it might be stated that the products of. Vemo Herb and Acid Lac could be utilized successfully as growth stimulators that replace the nutritive doses of antibiotics for starter pigs.					0	0		0	0	1			Agriculture; Developmental Biology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy	0514-7441				Animal Husbandry (Agriculture); Development; Pharmacognosy (Pharmacology)	10060, Biochemistry studies - General; 12512, Pathology - Therapy; 13202, Nutrition - General studies, nutritional status and methods; 22003, Pharmacology - Drug metabolism and metabolic stimulators; 25502, Development and Embryology - General and descriptive; 26502, Animal production - General and methods; 38502, Chemotherapy - General, methods and metabolism; 38504, Chemotherapy - Antibacterial agents; 51510, Plant physiology - Growth, differentiation; 54000, Pharmacognosy and pharmaceutical botany	Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Anacardiaceae [25565]; [Cotinus coggygria; (medicinal plant)]/Dicotyledones, Angiospermae, Spermatophyta, Plantae; Angiosperms, Dicots, Plants, Spermatophytes, Vascular Plants; Compositae [25840]; [Tanacetum vulgare; (medicinal plant)]/Plantae; Plants; Plantae [11000]; [Cichoria intybus; (medicinal plant)]/Artiodactyla, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Artiodactyls, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Suidae [85740]; [pig]		acid lac; metabolic-drug; (food additive)/additives/flavophospholipol; antibacterial-drug, antiinfective-drug; (food additive)/organic acids/vemo herb; growth stimulant-drug; (dietary supplement, food additive)			Bulgaria; Europe; Palearctic region								2022-07-19	BCI:BCI200500117237
J		Article		Evidence of a planktonic food web response to changes in nutrient input dynamics in the Mar Menor coastal lagoon, Spain		Perez-Ruzafa, A.; Gilabert, J.; Gutierrez, J. M.; Fernandez, A. I.; Marcos, C.; Sabah, S.									Hydrobiologia		2002	15 May, 2002	475-476		359-369	359	369	English	print					Nutrient input dynamics in the Mar Menor coastal lagoon has recently changed as a consequence of changes in agricultural practises. An interannual comparison of the environmental variables and the planktonic biomass size-spectra was performed between 1988 and 1997. While nitrate concentration was low in 1988, the values in 1997 increased considerably. Since 1995, two alloctonous jellyfish species (Rhyzostoma pulmo and Cotylorhiza tuberculata) occurred in large numbers in summer time and reached peak abundance in summer of 1997. The size-spectra analysis comparison revealed that, in spite of changes in nutrient input that stimulated the growth of larger phytoplankton cells, there were no significant differences in the spectra slope which followed a similar seasonal trend in both years. However, the plankton biovolume considered under the size range compared (between 2 and 1000 mum diameter) was, paradoxically, always lower in 1997. Given that there were higher nutrient levels in 1997, this finding suggest a strong top-down control mechanism of size structure. Gut contents of jellyfishes showed their preference for large diatoms, tintinnids, veliger larvae and copepods, corroborating that size structure in these assemblages can be subject to top-down control. The implication of these results is that the feeding activities of large gelatinous zooplankton (jellyfishes) may play an important role controlling the consequences of eutrophication within the Mar Menor coastal lagoon.

J		Article		The role of autotoxins from root residues of the previous crop in the replant disease of asparagus		Blok, W. J.; Bollen, G. J.									Netherlands Journal of Plant Pathology		1994		99	SUPPL. 3	29-40	29	40	English						Replant disease is a common phenomenon in asparagus crowing in the Netherlands. It is distinct from the decline phenomenon reported from many other asparagus producing area's. The involvement of autotoxins from root residues of former asparagus crops was evaluated. Residues of asparagus roots decompose extremely slowly. At two locations, each with fields where asparagus production was terminated 1 and 10 years before, biomass of root residues was 4180 and 11060 kg dw ha-1 after 1 year and 420 and 1140 kg dw ha-1 after 10 years. Although 10-year-old residues were for the greater part decomposed, crude aqueous extracts inhibited root growth of asparagus seedlings significantly and even more of garden cress. In root observation boxes with field soil mixed with non-sterilized or sterilized asparagus root fragments, growth of secondary roots was inhibited. Non-sterilized strawberry roots did not inhibit root growth, suggesting that effects of organic matter were not involved. In a pot experiment, sterilized asparagus root fragments inhibited root growth when added at a rate of 20 g l-1, but not at 2 g l-1. Addition of non-sterilized root fragments strongly inhibited root growth at both levels. This was probably due to simultaneous infection by Fusarium oxysporum present in these residues. When an asparagus field is replanted, the amount of root residues left behind in soil after termination of the crop in the previous season is about 2 g dw l-1, that corresponds to approx. 11000 kg dw ha-1. This level is too low for considering direct growth inhibition by autotoxins as a major factor. Their possible indirect effects are briefly discussed.	Dep. Phytopathology, Wageningen Agric.

Bacteriocin activity was degraded by proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, alfa-chymotrypsin, papaine, protease, proteinase K and acid proteases), and it was stable at high temperatures (121 degrees C, 20 min), in a wide range of pH (1-12), and after treatment with organic solvents. L. Plantarum J23 showed antimicrobial activity against Oenococcus oeni, and a range of Lactobacillus and Pediococcus species. Bacteriocin production was detected in liquid media only when J23 was cocultivated with some inducing bacteria, and induction took place when intact cells or 55 degrees C heated cells of the inducer were cocultivated with J23, but not with their autoclaved cells. Bacteriocin activity of J23 was not induced by high initial J23 inocula, and it was detected in cocultures during the exponential phase. The presence of ethanol or acidic pH in the media reduced bacteriocin production in the cocultures of J23 with the inducing bacteria. The presence of plantaricin-related plnEF and plnJ genes was detected by PCR and sequencing. Nevertheless, negative results were obtained for plnA, plnK, plNC8, plS and plW genes.

Journal of Veterinary Medicine Series B		2001	June, 2001	48	5	347-355	347	355	English	print					Two cases of meningitis due to Streptococcus suis in humans are reported here. A butcher and an abattoir worker were referred to a health centre in Castellon (Spain) with fever and symptoms of meningitis. After adequate treatment, a slight hipoacusia persisted as sequelae in both cases. Colonies of S. suis group R, serotype 2 and phenotype MRP+EF+ were isolated from cerebroespinal fluid. Epidemiological studies showed that both workers had in common the handling of pork meat of slaughtered healthy pigs from three closed farms. A study of the tonsils from apparently healthy, slaughtered pigs was carried out. A total of 234 tonsillar samples were obtained and 81 strains of S. suis were isolated from them. Serotype 2 appeared to be the most frequent (50.6%), and the analysis for phenotype showed a high percentage of tonsillar strains with the phenotype MRP+EF+ (35.9 %). The humans and 28 tonsillar swine strains showed a similar profile (S. suis group R, serotype 2 and phenotype MRP+EF+). A total of 26 of the swine isolates were analysed by ribotyping using EcoRI. The human strains showed the same six-band hybridization pattern that shared five bands with the pattern most frequently shown by most of the tonsillar S. suis group R, serotype 2 and phenotype MRP+EF+ strains, differing only in the lightest, faintest band which was slightly less anodical in human (gtoreq 1.8 kb) than in swine (apprxeq1.8 kb). From these results, both groups of strains, humans' and porcine, showed differences; how can these differences in the pattern of ribotyping be explained if they should have the same origin?

J		Article		Spatial variability of glyphosate mineralization and soil microbial characteristics in two Norwegian sandy loam soils as affected by surface topographical features		Stenrod, Marianne (marianne.stenrod@planteforsk.no) ; Charnay, Marie-Paule; Benoit, Pierre; Eklo, Ole Martin									Soil Biology & Biochemistry		2006	MAY 2006	38	5	962-971	962	971	English						The aim of this study was to investigate the possible influence of surface topographical features on the spatial variability of glyphosate degradation and some microbial characteristics in sandy loam soil. Soil samples were taken from the ploughed layer across an agricultural field after seedbed preparation for grain (Grue site), and down to I m depth under a ridge tilled field (Malselv site), both sites having similar soil textural characteristics (sandy loam soil). Laboratory experiments were performed looking at glyphosate mineralization and soil microbial activity at the Grue site, as well as microbial biomass, activity and substrate utilization patterns at the Malselv site. Microbial biomass and activity decreased, and substrate utilization patterns changed with increasing soil depth, reflecting naturally occurring changes in quantity and quality of soil organic carbon. Further, our results show that considerable spatial heterogeneity in the degradation rate of glyphosate and general carbon utilization exists even across small areas within a single agricultural field. This horizontal variability was observed over several spatial scales, and could not be clearly explained. It evidently arose from differences in environmental factors affecting microbial activity and growth, and topographical features controlling redistribution of water and matter flow patterns were correlated to the investigated soil microbial variables.

J	16003827	Article		Spatial variability in C-14-herbicide degradation in surface and subsurface soils		Charnay, Marie-Paule (charnay@grignon.inra.fr) ; Tuis, Sebastien; Coquet, Yves; Barriuso, Enrique									Pest Management Science		2005	SEP 2005	61	9	845-855	845	855	English						The spatial variability in mineralization of atrazine, isoproturon and metamitron in soil and subsoil samples taken from a 135-ha catchment in north France was studied. Fifty-one samples from the top layer were taken to represent exhaustively the 31 agricultural fields and 21 soil types of the catchment. Sixteen additional samples were collected between depths of 0.7 and 10 m to represent the major geological materials encountered in the vadose zone of the catchment. All these samples were incubated with C-14-labelled atrazine under laboratory conditions at 28 degrees C. Fourteen selected surface samples which exhibited distinctly different behaviour for atrazine dissipation (including sorption and mineralization) were incubated with C-14-isoproturon and C-14-metamitron. Overall soil microbial activity and specific herbicide degradation activities were monitored during the incubations through measurements of total carbon dioxide and C-14-carbon dioxide respectively. At the end of the incubations, extractable and non-extractable (bound) residues remaining in soils were measured. Variability of herbicide dissipation half-life in soil surface samples was lower for atrazine and metamitron (CV < 12%) than for isoproturon (CV = 46%). The main contributor to the isoproturon dissipation variability was the variability of the extractable residues. For the other herbicides, spatial variability was mainly related to the variability of their mineralization. In all cases, herbicide mineralization half-lives showed higher variability than those of dissipation. Sorption or physicochemical soil properties could not explain atrazine and isoproturon degradation, whose main factors were probably directly related to the dynamics of the specific microbial degradation activity. In contrast, variability of metamitron degradation was significantly correlated to sorption coefficient (K-d) through correlation with the sorptive soil components, organic matter and clay. Herbicide degradation decreased with depth as did the overall microbial activity. Atrazine mineralization activity was found down to a depth of 2.5 m; beyond that, it was negligible.

Tellervo									International Journal for Parasitology		1997		27	1	89-99	89	99	English						Protozoan ectoparasites were examined in a northern salmonid fish farm over a 10-year period, June 1984-May 1994, by the same researcher, with similar catching and sampling procedures throughout. Husbandry procedures remained constant during the study, e.g., fingerlings were kept in steel tanks and yearlings in both steel tanks and earth ponds. Ichthyobodo necator, Chilodonella hexasticha and Ichthyophthirius multifiliis infections were treated with formalin, salt and malachite green-formalin baths, respectively, whenever any parasites were found. Altogether 10 790 randomly sampled salmon (Salmo solar), sea trout (S. trutta m. trutta) and brown trout (S. trutta m. lacustris) were studied. Higher prevalences were found in yearlings than in fingerlings, except in L. necator infections, which were higher in fingerlings (e.g., 26% vs 6% in sea trout). C. hexasticha occurred less often and was found most commonly on brown trout fingerlings. Trichodina nigra occurred more often in salmon of both age groups and Riboscyphidia arctic in trout. The results show that the occurrence of protozoan parasites in a fish farm is predictable and is influenced by the fish species, the age group of the fish, the season and the tank type. Parasite burden increased up to 7 species per brown trout, e.g., when fish were studied from hatching until stocking at the age of 2 years.	Rintamaki-Kinnunen, Paivi; Dep. Biol., Univ. Oulu, P.O.

J		Technical Report		Sharing the waters: An evaluation of site fallowing, year class separation and distances between sites for fish health purposes on Atlantic salmon farms		Stewart, James E.									Canadian Technical Report of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences		1998		0	2218	I-VII, 1-56	I		English	print					This evaluation led to several clear conclusions. These were: 1) Fallowing and year class separation when coupled with Single Bay or Single Area Management are effective additions to fish health care and 2) the benefits from these three measures are fully realized only when they are joined to a basic set of sound farming practices and 3) none of the distances (mandatory or suggested) between sites in Norway, Scotland, Ireland, Chile and British Columbia are great enough to be barriers to the spread of infectious agents and the attendant diseases. Fallowing has been shown to be effective in sea lice control by breaking the life cycle of the parasites and is believed also to reduce the problem of microbial diseases through removal of the host concentrations resulting in a decline in microbial pathogen numbers as well as benefits from flushing the area with clean water. Adding to the direct hazards of sea lice is the fact that they are apparent vectors for the spread of certain diseases. The fallowing periods recommended in the different countries range from 1 to 3 months; because of the cooler waters of the Bay of Fundy it is suggested that fallowing there would require at least two months to be effective against sea lice and that a three month period would be a safer provision. A major problem with fallowing is that for it to work alternate sites are required, a production site and a fallowing site. In Norway each farm must have an alternate site; in Scotland farms routinely have 3-4 sites through which production can be rotated. Ireland is in the midst of resolving this problem. Control of microbially caused diseases in Europe appears to have been achieved largely through ensuring that smolts, from strains selected for hardiness and rapid growth, are free of diseases and usually vaccinated before being transferred to seawater to avoid introducing pathogens in the first place and to offer-protection against those which may already be present at the farm site. This plus good farm practice coupled with rapid confinement and eradication of developing disease situations have been the prime tools employed. Considerable effort has been focused on developing technology (nutritional and genetic) to accelerate growth thereby minimizing the period the fish have to be held at the farm site and as a consequence reducing exposure to disease and other hazards. The data illustrate that specific distances should not be the prime measure for guarding against the spread of infectious diseases. The problems inherent in relying on distance for this purpose are summed up in the maxim "Share the water share the disease". Limited mathematical modelling of the Passamaquoddy Bay region suggests that there may be several areas which are separated sufficiently to offer protection against the spread of infectious diseases. A final decision on this point should be based upon mathematical modelling of the area using a continuous insertion of suitable proxies for disease agents. Strategies involving full time or seasonal offshore/inshore rearing and fallowing rotations are discussed briefly. It is possible combinations of these strategies could be devised and applied with benefit to fish health in the Passamaquoddy Bay region of New Brunswick.	Stewart, James E.; Sci.

J		Article	Literature Review	Learning from the past: Palaeohydrology and palaeoecology		Brown, A. G.									Freshwater Biology		2002	April, 2002	47	4	817-829	817	829	English	print					Attempts to increase European biodiversity by restoring rivers and floodplains are based on inadequate data on natural systems. This is particularly the case for NW European rivers because all catchments have been impacted by agriculture and river engineering. If river restoration is to have an ecological, as opposed to 'cosmetic' design basis then baseline models are required. However, this poses three questions; (a) what is the natural river-floodplain state, (b) how can it be defined and modelled and (c) can this state be recreated today? The first two questions can only be addressed by using palaeohydrological and palaeoecological data. A second and equally vital consideration is the stability/instability of any restored system to change in external forcing factors (e.g. climate) and in this context it may not be realistic to expect baseline models to provide equilibrium solutions but instead to define process-form domains. Over the last two decades evidence has accumulated that the natural state of lowland rivers in much of NW Europe was multi rather than single thread-braided, anastomosing or anabranching. Until recently our knowledge of floodplain palaeoecology was generally derived from pollen diagrams, which have source-area of problems and lack of taxonomic specificity. The precision and breadth of palaeoecological reconstruction (including richness and structure) has been greatly increased by the use of multiple palaeo-indicators including macrofossils, diatoms and beetles. The dynamics of small to medium sized, low-energy, predeforestation floodplains were dominated by disturbance (windthrow, beavers, etc.) and large woody debris. In order to compare the hydrogeomorphological basis of floodplain ecology, both temporally and spatially, a simple index of fluvial complexity is presented. Palaeoecological and geomorphological investigations have the potential to provide in-depth models of the natural range of channel conditions and sensitivity to external change that can be used to provide a scientific basis for floodplain restoration. There is also the possibility that floodplain-channel restoration may be a valuable tool in the mitigation of future geomorphological change forced by climatic instability.	Brown, A.

J		Article		Decomposition in the field of residues of oilseed rape grown at two levels of nitrogen fertilisation. Effects on the dynamics of soil mineral nitrogen between successive crops		Trinsoutrot, I.; Nicolardot, B.; Justes, E.; Recous, S.									Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems		2000	Feb., 2000	56	2	125-137	125	137	English	print					The decomposition of oilseed rape residues of different quality and its effects on the mineral N dynamics of the soil in the period between crops were studied in situ. The residues studied were obtained by growing an oilseed rape crop at two levels of N fertilisation, 0 and 270 kg N ha-1. The study was carried out using two types of experiment: field plots and cylinders filled with disturbed soil and inserted into the soil. The decomposition of the residues was followed using an approach involving the dynamics of both carbon and nitrogen, the parameters measured being the CO2 emitted from the soil, the soil mineral N content, the C present in soluble form or in the form of microbial biomass, and the C and N present in the form of plant residues. The two residues studied, of similar biochemical composition, and differing only in their N content, were rapidly mineralised: approximately 50% of the carbon in the residues was decomposed during the first two months following incorporation into the soil. The carbon mineralised in the form of CO2 was largely related to the C present in the residues, no relationship having been found with the C present in soluble form or in the form of microbial biomass. Calculation of net N mineralisation from the residues using a model of mineralisation and leaching has provided evidence of an immobilisation phase for soil mineral N, during the first steps of residues decomposition. Labelling the high-N residues with 15N has moreover enabled us to demonstrate the low availability of the organic N from this residue, 20.8% of the organic N being mineralised in the course of 18 months of experimentation. Eventually, only the highest-N content residue resulted in a mineral N surplus in the soil, equivalent to 9 kg N ha-1, by comparison with the control soil. Finally, this study has provided good evidence of the complementarity between the two experimental methods. The cylinders of disturbed soil gave a precise measurement of the decomposition of the residues, especially by means of monitoring soil respiration. The field plots were used to monitor the dynamics of soil mineral N which were calculated with the aid of a mathematical model of mineralisation and leaching of nitrogen in the presence and absence of residues.

J		Article		Mineralisation of nitrogen from an incorporated catch crop at low temperatures: Experiment and simulation		Van Scholl, L.; Van Dam, A. M.; Leffelaar, P. A.									Plant and Soil		1997		188	2	211-219	211	219	English						The release of nitrogen from incorporated catch crop material in winter is strongly influenced by soil temperatures. A laboratory experiment was carried out to investigate this influence in the range of 1-15 degree C. Samples of sandy soil or a mixture of sandy soil with rye shoots were incubated at 1-5-10-15 degree C, and samples of sandy soil with rye roots were incubated at 5-10-15 degree C. Concentrations of N-min (NH-4+-N and NO-3--N) were measured after 0-1-2-4-7-10 weeks for the sandy soil and the sandy soil:rye shoot mixture, and after 0-2-7-10 weeks for the sandy soil:rye root mixture. At 1 degree C, 20% of total organic N in the crop material had been mineralised after ten weeks, indicating that mineralisation at low temperatures is not negligible. Maximum mineralisation occurred at 15 degree C; after ten weeks, it was 39% of total applied organic nitrogen from shoot and 35% from root material. The time course of mineralisation was calculated using an exponential decay function. It was found that the influence of temperature in the range 1-15 degree C could be described by the Arrhenius equation, stating a linear increase of ln(k) with T-1, k being the relative mineralisation rate in day-1 and T the temperature ( degree C). A simulation model was developed in which decomposition, mineralisation and nitrification were modelled as one step processes, following first order kinetics. The relative decomposition rate was influenced by soil temperature and soil moisture content, and the mineralisation of N was calculated from the decomposition of C, the C to N ratio of the catch crop material and the C to N ratio of the microbial biomass. The model was validated first with the results of the experiment. The model was further validated with the results of an independent field experiment, with temperatures fluctuating between 3 and 20 degree C. The simulated time course of mineralisation differed significantly from the experimental values, due to an underestimation of the mineralisation during the first weeks of incubation.	Dep.

J		Article	Literature Review	Lakes in the Netherlands, their origin, eutrophication and restoration: State-of-the-art review.		Gulati, Ramesh D. (gulati@cl.nioo.knaw.nl) ; Van Donk, Ellen									Hydrobiologia		2002	15 June, 2002	478		73-106	73	106	English	print					This article starts with a brief description of the origin and eutrophication of shallow Dutch lakes, followed by a review of the various lake restoration techniques in use and the results obtained. Most freshwater lakes in the Netherlands are very shallow (<2 m), and owe their origins to large-scale dredging and removal of peat during the early 17th century. They vary in area from a few hectares to a few thousand hectares, and are generally found in the northern and western part of the country. Most of them lie in the catchment areas of the major rivers: the Rhine, the Meuse and the Schelde. Because of their natural and aesthetic value, these lakes fulfil a recreational function. The lakes are important to the hydrology, water balance and agriculture in the surrounding polder country. The external input to the lakes of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) and of polluted waters from the rivers and canals have been the major cause of eutrophication, which began during the 1950s. In addition, more recently climate changes, habitat fragmentation and biotic exploitation of many of these waters have probably led to loss of resilience and thus to accelerated eutrophication. Lake eutrophication is manifested essentially in the poor under-water light climate with high turbidity (Secchi-disc, 20-40 cm) caused usually by cyanobacterial blooms (e.g. Oscillatoria sp.), and loss of littoral vegetation. Despite recent perceptible reductions in external P inputs, non-point sources, especially of N from agriculture, still remain high and constitute a major challenge to the lake restorers. Lake recovery is also invariably afflicted by in-lake nutrient sources. These include P loading from the P-rich sediments, mineralization in the water and release by the foraging and metabolic activities of the abundant benthivorous and planktivorous fish, mainly bream (Abramis brama). A variety of restoration techniques have been employed in the Dutch lakes: hydrological management, reduction of P in the external loads, in-lake reduction or immobilisation of P, and complementary ecological management. This last involves biomanipulation, or the top-down control of the food web. Hydrological management has resulted in an improvement in the lake water quality only in a few cases. The failure of lake restoration measures (e.g. in the Loosdrecht lakes, described as a case study) has led water managers to use biomanipulation in other takes under restoration. Lake biomanipulation principally involves reducing the existing planktivore population, bream in most cases, and introducing piscivores such as northern pike (Esox lucius). Lake Zwemlust is discussed as a case study, with brief mention of some other small lakes which have been biomanipulated. The restoration studies reveal that decrease of P to low levels is no guarantee that cyanobacterial populations will also follow suit. This is because cyanobacteria can withstand great variation in their P content and thus in their C:P ratios. Thus, for a unit weight of P, the Cyanobacteria can yield relatively more biomass and cause greater turbidity than, for example, green algae, which have relatively lower C:P ratios. This is possibly an explanation for the success of these filamentous Cyanobacteria in many Dutch lakes, and the failure of restoration endeavours. In addition, a falling trend in chlorophyll-a content in these shallow lakes does not set off an immediate increase in lake transparency because of resuspension of seston and inorganic suspended matter from the lake bottom by both wind-induced waves and fish foraging activity. The zooplankton-grazing peak in spring, caused usually by large-bodied grazers, Daphnia spp., is invariably the first step in bringing about a clear-water phase. Subsequently, summer light conditions trigger optimal growth conditions for macrophytes, which then maintain the high water clarity by competing successfully with phytoplankton for nutrients, especially N. The 'return' of macrophytes, especially stoneworts (Chara spp.) in some lakes, has contributed to the sustaining of improved light conditions and success of the restoration measures. In addition to competing with phytoplankton for nutrients, the macrophytes exert their positive influence in manifold ways. They act as a major nutrient sink, provide refuges for zooplankton and young pike and reduce wind- and fish-induced bioturbation of sediment. Most restoration accomplishments in recent years have been attributed to the success of aquatic macrovegetation. In general, the achievements of restoration work in the Dutch lakes, especially those using biomanipulation measures, are questionable: there are probably more examples of failures than of successes. The failures are generally linked not only to insufficient or no decrease at all in the autochthonous or in-lake nutrient loadings, but also to rapid increase of the planktivorous fish in the years following their reduction. A 75% reduction in the existing planktivore population has often been used as an arbitrary yardstick for effective reduction, but may not be sufficient. However, fish stock reductions to <50 kg FW ha-1 and maintenance at that level might have a greater chance of success, though maintaining the existing fish population at preconceived levels is difficult since for reasons not yet fully understood, piscivores, pike in particular, fail to develop sizeable populations. Studies so far have helped us recognise that for sustainability of the positive effects on water quality, 'natural development' should be central to future lake restoration programmes. Future restoration plans typically visualise lakes as integral parts of their landscape, and envisage their 'nature development'. Such thinking aims at reinforcing the lakes' shoreline vegetation to prevent erosion and improve the subtlety of the land-water transition (e.g. Volkerak Zoommeer lake system). Where in-lake P stocks have retarded the pace of lake recovery (e.g. Loosdrecht Lakes), excavation of 20-30 m deep pits in shallower lake areas to allow wind-induced shifting of the nutrient-rich upper sediment layers and burial in the pits in order to hinder P releases from the sediments is now under way. For some lakes the creation of artificial islands to reduce the wind fetch factor and erosion has been planned; in other cases, more natural development of the quasi-aquatic ecosystems by water-level management in order to encourage the shoreline macrovegetation to develop has been planned. Such plans also have the provision of extending the upper and lower limits for permissible annual water-level fluctuations and exploring the effects of transient draw-downs. Ideally, near-natural water levels, unlike the current levels, are under consideration as possibly being the best option, also bearing climate change in mind. However, the consequences of flooding and recessions on the ecosystems and other water uses by man still need to be thoroughly investigated. In short, the experiences acquired from the failures and some successes of the last two decades should pave the way to development of more enduring strategies for sustainable restoration of our lake ecosystems.

J	10856815	Article		Cross-sectional serological survey on gastrointestinal and lung nematode infections in first and second-year replacement stock in The Netherlands: Relation with management practices and use of anthelmintics		Ploeger, H. W.; Borgsteede, F. H. M.; Sol, J.; Mirck, M. H.; Huyben, M. W. C.; Kooyman, F. N. J.; Eysker, M.									Veterinary Parasitology		2000	4 July, 2000	90	4	285-304	285	304	English	print					A cross-sectional survey was carried out on 86 farms randomly distributed in The Netherlands. After housing following the first and the second grazing season (FGS and SGS) serum samples were collected to determine IgG levels against Cooperia oncophora and Dictyocaulus viviparus, and the pepsinogen content. A questionnaire was used to inquire on grazing management practices and the use of anthelmintic drugs. On 80.7 and 60.2% of the farms FGS and SGS animals, respectively, were treated at least once with an anthelmintic drug. The percentage for the SGS animals indicates that the use of anthelmintic drugs in those animals has increased enormously over the last 10-15 years. Generally, parasitic nematode control in the FGS is good on most farms, but it can be characterised as being overprotective. There is a tendency that if anthelmintic drugs are used in the FGS they also are used more often in the SGS. On 12 farms (14%), no anthelmintic drugs were given in the FGS and the SGS. These farms did not differ from the others with respect to management practices in any obvious way. The serological results were in general very low, indicating low levels of exposure to gastrointestinal nematode infection in both FGS and SGS animals. This was not surprising in view of the good to high level of nematode control practices reported by the farmers. Although not statistically significant, a consistent result was that serological results for the SGS animals were more often positive or on average higher on those farms where FGS parasite control tended to be excessive. For D. viviparus, a prevalence rate of 41% positive farms was found. Following comparison with previous data, it is speculated that lungworm (sero-)prevalence in replacement stock may be declining as a result of continuing high levels of parasite control in replacement stock. It is concluded that the results confirm previous surveys, lending support to the conclusion that parasitic nematode control on Dutch dairy farms, certainly in FGS calves, is good but tends to be overprotective.

J		Article	Literature Review	Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) and the development of a viral vaccine		Pettersen, Eirin Fausa									Norsk Veterinaer		1997		109	8-9	499-505	499	505	Norwegian	print					Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) and the development of a viral vaccine IPNV, causing the disease infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) in fish, was the first virus isolated from fish, and it is the most extensively studied and best characterized. IPNV is a medium-sized, unenveloped, bisegmented dsRNA-containing virus in the family Birnaviridae. The virus has a world-wide distribution, and it has been isolated from many different species of fish in the freshwater, brackish and marine environments, as well as from marine molluscs and crustacea. In Norway, IPNV was first isolated in 1975, and in 1985 the first outbreak of IPN in salmon fry occurred. During the last few years, an increasing number of IPN outbreaks have occurred among post-smolts, and in Norwegian fish farming industry, IPN is now considered to be one of the most economically important diseases. Since the 1970s, several laboratories around the world have been involved in research programs to develop an effective vaccine for IPNV. Experiments have been carried out with inactivated, attenuated and recombinant vaccines. The experiments with inactivated (i.e. killed) IPNV vaccines started in the 1970s. Trials were made with intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections, oral vaccination and immersion vaccination. Some trials resulted in protective immunity, but the positive results were scarce and difficult to reproduce. This led many research groups to conclude that an inactivated IPNV vaccine was not eligible. But the work was resumed, and in Norway an inactivated IPNV vaccine is now available. In the 1970s and 1980s a great amount of work was carried out in the attempt to create an attenuated IPNV strain suitable for a live virus vaccine, but none was found. Subunit vaccines produced by recombinant DNA techniques for IPNV have been under development since the mid 1980s. Most of these studies have focused on the major capsid protein, VP2. The gene encoding VP2 have been cloned and expressed in E. coli. Vaccine trials have been made with immersion vaccination and i.p. injections. It has been shown that vaccination with a recombinant vaccine can induce an increased antibody response against IPNV. In Norway, a recombinant vaccine based on the Norwegian N1 strain of IPNV, is now available.	Pettersen, Eirin Fausa; Univ. Bergen, Inst.

J		Article		A green warrior on the offensive, or Stratiotes in water ecosystems	Zielony wojownik w natarciu, czyli osoka w ekosystemach wodnych	Strzalek, Malgorzata									Wiadomosci Ekologiczne		2004		50	2	81-107	81	107	Polish	print					The water soldier (Stratiotes aloides L.) is a common species in Polish lowland waters native to areas situated north to the line Krakow-Przemysl. It grows in eu-and mesotrophic (rarely dystrophic) waters rich in calcium and of pH between 4.5 and 8.5. It avoids waters of low phosphorus concentrations (below 1 M) and of high ammonium nitrogen. The water soldier usually inhabits shallow stagnant waters with the substratum composed of a thick layer of mud and organic deposits (shallow parts of lakes, ox-bow lakes, fishponds, peatbog hollows and draining ditches). Only seldom it can be found in running waters. S. aloides is a dioecious entomogameous perennial plant of the Hydrocharitaceae family. It has a shortened rhizome from which horny leaves outgrow to form a rosette. Long stringlike roots anchor the plant to the substratum (Fig. 1). The plant is peculiar in its ability to move vertically in the water column during a year (Fig. 2) and in its capability to produce two types of vegetative propagules (Fig. 1). Due to its expansive character and a high productivity (which often results in outcompeting other macrophytes including charophytes) the plant may strongly affect the functioning of a water body. S. aloides occurs in two morphological forms: a shapely form that dominates in water bodies and a weak form that produces scarce populations in shore parts of the littoral. The two forms develop from different propagules, from winter buds and turions, respectively Shapely formed water soldier may produce three distinct ecophenotypes: early emergent, late emergent and submerged which differ in morphology, phenology and distribution in a water reservoir (Fig. 3). S. aloides mainly reproduces asexually. Generative reproduction is often hampered by spatial separation of sexes and seeds produced only in parts of the geographic range of the plant undergo dormancy which significantly restrict generative recruitment of young individuals. The water soldier accumulates relatively large amounts of K+ and Na+ Calcium ions often co-precipitate with phosphates and form incrustations on the surface of submerged leaves. Thus, the plant may modify electrolytic conductivity, pH and alkalinity of water and indirectly affect phytoplankton growth. Late emergent and submerged forms of S. aloides compete with phytoplankton by producing large surface for the uptake of ions and early emergent form may compete with algae through shading. Some authors expected the involvement of allelopathic effects in this competition, though no substances of such properties have been isolated yet. Other nutrients are most probably taken up by S. aloides from the substratum. S. aloides is a habitat for diverse epiphytic and mining fauna which may reach high densities. According to numerous studies, chironomids are the dominating group though their structure and densities depend largely on the fish stock in the water body The water soldier is often a food for other invertebrates and vertebrates. It is also a shelter and feeding ground for small Cyprinidae and offers a nesting place for some waterfowl (Chlidonias niger; Ch. leucopterus). Modern agricultural practice and rivers regulation contribute to the withdrawal of S. abides from lakes in Slovakia, Austria, eastern England or the Netherlands. Dutch scientists explained the phenomenon by a multiple environmental stress hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, competition for light with pleustophytes and filamentous algae, iron limitation and the toxicity of sulfides and ammonium ions are all responsible for the observed decline in the populations of S. aloides. The water soldier accompanies man for ages mainly as a component of aquatic gardens. Hopefully, after Polish accession to EU our populations of S. abides will not share the fate of west European populations and we'll be able to enjoy the plants in their natural habitats.

J	16867054	Article		The role of parasitic infections in atopic diseases in rural schoolchildren		Karadag, B.; Ege, M.; Bradley, J. E.; Braun-Fahrlaender, C.; Riedler, J.; Nowak, D.; von Mutius, E.									Allergy (Oxford)		2006	AUG 2006	61	8	996-1001	996	1001	English						Background: There is increasing evidence that the farming environment has a protective effect as regards allergic diseases. Exposure to animal parasites, particularly helminth infections, is common in the farming environment. However, the role of helminths in this environment is not well determined to date.Methods: This analysis focuses on 613 children 6-13 years of age from rural areas of Austria, Germany and Switzerland, who took part in the Allergy and Endotoxin (ALEX) study. Allergic diseases and farming characteristics were assessed by a standardized questionnaire and as a crude measure of possible exposure to helminths, IgG antibodies to Ascaris lumbricoides were measured.Results: Exposure to nematodes, as determined by the levels of antibody to A. lumbricoides, was more frequent among farmers' children than non-farmers' children (39.8%vs 31.1%, P = 0.03). This positive serology was found to be significantly associated with high total IgE levels [odds ratio (OR) = 3.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.81-5.12] and eosinophilia (OR = 2.84, 95% CI = 1.66-4.84). However, no association between anti-nematode serology and the prevalences of asthma, wheeze, hay fever or atopy was found. A weak association for atopy was observed after adjustment for total IgE.Conclusion: Immunoglobulin G antibodies to A. lumbricoides, as a crude measure of possible exposure to helminths, did not indicate any protective effect against allergic diseases in this population. Although farmers' children had increased antibody levels reactive to helminth parasites indicating exposure, this did not explain the protective effect of farming against atopic diseases.

J		Article		Effects of afforestation on ammonification and nitrification rates in former agricultural soils		Haque, S. M. S.; Billett, M. F.; Grayston, S.; Ord, B. G.									Soil Use and Management		1999	June, 1999	15	2	117-122	117	122	English	print					The effects of afforestation on potential nitrification, nitrification and ammonification rates were studied at an experimental site in NE Scotland 4 1/2 years after afforestation of former arable land. The site had been planted with three tree species (Sitka spruce, sycamore and hybrid larch) at three different planting densities, with half the plots treated with inorganic NPK fertilizer. Laboratory measurements of potential nitrification, nitrification and ammonification rates, measured using a perfusion system, were compared between the unforested control and combinations of the various treatments. Differences in soil pH and soil moisture content were also investigated. Potential nitrification rates measured in plantation soils were significantly lower than in the unplanted control soil. Nitrification and ammonification rates were also consistently lower, although these differences were only significant in a few of the treatments. Soils planted with a normal tree density had a tendency to show higher nitrification rates compared to soils planted with a high tree density. The results suggest that afforestation of former agricultural soils may cause changes in important parts of the soil N cycle soon after planting. At this early stage in the life of the plantation this appears to be unrelated to changes in soil pH or moisture content, even though soils beneath the trees are drier. The apparent change may be the result of differences in the soil microbial community associated with the type of organic matter substrate present in the unplanted and planted soils.	Billett, M.

J		Article		The effect of different land uses on soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen in BArtin province		Kara, Oemer (omerkara@karaelmas.edu.tr) ; Bolat, Ilyas									Turkish Journal of Agriculture and Forestry		2008		32	4	281-288	281	288	English						The microbial biomass of soil is being increasingly recognized as a sensitive indicator of soil quality. Its knowledge is fundamental for sustainable environmental management. This study aimed to determine the impact of different land uses (forest, pasture, and agricultural lands) on soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen using the chloroform fumigation extraction (CFE) method. This study also aimed to determine interrelationships between microbial biomass C (C-mic) and N (N-mic) and the physicochemical characteristics of the soil. For this purpose, a total of 45 soil samples were taken from 3 different land uses located in the Agdaci Village in Bartin. Additional core samples were collected from each sample site to determine other physico-chemical characteristics of the soils. The average microbial biomass C were found as 1028.29 mu g g(-1), 898.47 mu g g(-1), and 485.10 mu g g(-1) respectively, for forest, pasture, and agricultural soils. As with microbial biomass C, the average microbial biomass N was found as 129.99 mu g g(-1), 100.90 mu g g(-1), and 42.60 mu g g(-1), respectively, for forest, pasture, and agricultural soils. One-Way ANOVA showed a significant difference in microbial biomass C and N among the study areas. Microbial biomass C and N were shown to be significantly correlated to the physico-chemical properties of the soil, such as organic C, total N, clay, and pH. Present study clearly shows that land use has a significant effect on microbial biomass C and N in soil by altering natural soil characteristics under the same ecological conditions.

S		Book		Avian Influenza: Prevention and Control					Schrijver, RS; Koch, G						Avian Influenza: Prevention and Control	Wageningen Ur Frontis Series	2005		8					English						This 152-page book is volume 8 in the ''Wageningen UR Frontis Series'' and this volume focuses on prevention and control of Avian influenza, a disease which has become one of the biggest threats to human and animal health. This volume is structured into 5 parts and contains 15 individually-authored chapters. The first part of the book provides an introduction and discusses spread of avian influenza. There are 4 chapters in this first part, which individually discuss Avian influenza viruses and influenza in humans, zoonotic considerations of Avian influenza viruses in Hong Kong, live bird markets in northeastern USA as a source of avian influenza in commercial poultry, and Influenza A virus surveillance in wild birds. Outbreaks in densely populated poultry areas are the focus of the second part, which contains chapters 5-7, inclusive. Topics covered in these 3 chapters include the control of avian influenza in areas at risk, and in particular the Italian experience between 1997 and 2003; 2002 outbreaks of low-pathogenic H7N2 strain of Avian influenza virus in Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina; and the effectiveness of control measures on the transmission of Avian influenza virus H7N7 between flocks. The theme of the third part of the book is vaccination. Chapters 8-11, inclusive are in this third part, and topics covered in these 4 chapters include: currently available tools and strategies for emergency vaccination in case of avian influenza; evaluation of vaccination to support control of H5N1 strains of Avian influenza virus in Hong Kong; vaccination of poultry against Avian influenza; and the development of avian influenza vaccines for emergency use. Control measures and legislation are discussed in chapters 12 and 13, which are found in the fourth part, and the fifth and final part of the book discusses economics of avian influenza control. The final chapter is followed by concluding remarks, and a list of participants. The text is in English and each chapter is individually referenced. This book will appeal to epidemiologists, infectious disease experts, poultry producers, virologists, and government officials involved in infectious disease monitoring and control.					0	1		0	0	0	SPRINGER, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS	PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS	Infectious Diseases; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Agriculture	1573-4544(print)			1-4020-3439-3(H)	Infection; Public Health (Allied Medical Sciences); Epidemiology (Population Studies); Animal Husbandry (Agriculture)	12512, Pathology - Therapy; 16006, Respiratory system - Pathology; 22005, Pharmacology - Clinical pharmacology; 22018, Pharmacology - Immunological processes and allergy; 26502, Animal production - General and methods; 27002, Poultry production - General and methods; 33502, Virology - General and methods; 36006, Medical and clinical microbiology - Virology; 37001, Public health - General and miscellaneous; 37052, Public health: epidemiology - Communicable diseases; 37054, Public health: epidemiology - Organic diseases and neoplasms; 37056, Public health: epidemiology - Miscellaneous	Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Aves [85500]; [poultry; (host)] [wild bird; (host)]/Primates, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Humans, Mammals, Primates, Vertebrates; Hominidae [86215]; [human; (host)]/Negative Sense ssRNA Viruses, Viruses, Microorganisms; Microorganisms, Negative Sense Single-Stranded RNA Viruses, Viruses; Orthomyxoviridae [03505]; [Influenza A virus; (pathogen)] [Avian influenza virus; (pathogen; strain-H7N7, strain-H7N2, strain-H5N1)]	influenza; Influenza (MeSH); respiratory system disease, viral disease; transmission, epidemiology	avian influenza vaccine; immunologic-drug, immunostimulant-drug; (vaccine)			USA; North America; Nearctic region/Italy; Europe; Palearctic region/Hong Kong; Asia; Palearctic region/North Carolina; USA, North America; Nearctic region/Virginia; USA, North America; Nearctic region/West Virginia; USA, North America; Nearctic region		vaccination; clinical techniques		economics, epidemiological surveillance, live-bird markets, zoonotic considerations, commercial poultry production, densely populated poultry area, legislative control measures				2022-07-19	BCI:BCI200600281061
J		Article		Winter dysentery in dairy cattle herds caused by bovine coronavirus		Palfi, Vilmos									Magyar Allatorvosok Lapja		1999	Dec., 1999	121	12	733-739	733	739	Hungarian	print					During late winter and early spring in 1997 and 1998, an epizootic diarrhea prevailed among cattle over six months in dairy herds of two regions of Hungary. The disorder showed marked resemblance to the disease literally named 'winter dysentery' that is caused by Bovine Coronavirus (BCV). This disease had never been diagnosed in Hungary before. Investigations were carried out on 4 large and 7 small scale farms. The disease spread very quickly both among and within herds with a sudden onset of symptoms in affected herds. On large scale farms, the infection progressed in 3-4 days and appeared on animals kept in other buildings in 1-2 weeks. In large herds the morbidity was 80 per cent, while in small farms it could reach 100%. The affected animals showed anorexia and fever followed by a watery diarrhea, that became bloody or blood-stripped after 2-3 days. In milking cows, milk production decreased by 50-100 per cent, i.e. there was an overall decrease in excess of 50 per cent at farm level. The severity of symptoms decreased after about 5-6 days with the gradual disappearance of the diarrhea. Milk production returned to normal in 2-4 weeks depending on the size of the herd. In a large herd, losses were between 110-750 liter milk daily during the phase of diarrhea, totaling over 3000 USD. In another herd, the number of cows observed to be in heat decreased from the normal 6,3 to 2,9 per day during the course of the disease. Fecal and blood samples were sent for laboratory investigation from the affected farms. Feces and paired blood samples were tested from 5 herds showing acute symptoms. BCV was detected in feces samples from all five herds, however, only 22 out of 43 samples were positive with a direct ELISA method. Since blood samples were taken at the onset of infection, only three of these 22 BCV positive were positive for BCV antibodies by the HAI method. However, sero-conversion or rising titers specific to BCV were demonstrated in 39 of the 48 paired blood samples. HAI titers of 1:32-gtoreq 512 were found in 37 of the 40 reconvalescent sera from a total of 7 herds. These results indicate the causative role of BCV in epizootic diarrhea of adult cattle in Hungary.

J	15820119	Article		A quantitative assessment of the BSE risk associated with fly ash and slag from the incineration of meat-and-bone meal in a gas-fired power plant in Denmark		Paisley, Larry G. (lpa@dfvk.dk) ; Hostrup-Pedersen, Julie									Preventive Veterinary Medicine		2005	MAY 10 2005	68	2-4	263-275	263	275	English						It has been recommended that meat-and-bone meal (MBM) be incinerated at 850 degrees C for at least 2 s and the ashes and slag disposed of in controlled landfills, to dispose of animal-derived proteins. Most commonly, the MBM is incinerated in cement works or coal-fired power plants and the ashes and slag are incorporated into the cement or concrete.Our goal was to assess with a Monte Carlo simulation model the bovine spongiform, encephalopathy (BSE) risk to cattle and humans posed by the ash and slag. The results will be used by decision makers to evaluate the need for disposal of the fly ash in controlied landfills and the feasibility of use of the ash by the phosphate and fertilizer industries.We assumed that all specified risk material (SRM) and MBM produced in Denmark would be incinerated in this gas-fired power plant. Based on observations in 2001, we assumed that, on average, six (range: 0-15) clinical BSE cases each year were rendered into MBM and incinerated. In addition, SRM or carcasses from 0 to 31 (median = 10) BSE-infected-but-undetected animals[BSE case were also incinerated.The simulations were run on a 1 -week basis. Our results suggest that if the slag is collected and reincinerated the median BSE infectivity remaining in the fly ash per week would be 3. 1E-11 cattle ID50. A cattle ID50 is the amount of infectivity that will cause infection in 50% of cattle exposed to it. During the weeks when BSE was infected in the SRM-MBM, the median infectivity in the fly ash was estimated as 8.7E-10 cattle ID50 and 2.9E-12 human ID50. The 95th percentiles were 2.1E-08 cattle ID50 and 5.8E- 10 human ID50, respectively. One ton of fly ash would contain <= 1.8E-07 cattle ID50 95% of the time. These are the potential exposures of the cattle or human populations. The potential exposures of individuals are far less. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	11745492	Article		Primary liver cancer and occupation in men: A case-control study in a high-incidence area in Northern Italy		Porru, Stefano; Placidi, Donatella; Carta, Angela; Gelatti, Umberto; Ribero, Maria Luisa; Tagger, Alessandro; Boffetta, Paolo; Donato, Francesco									International Journal of Cancer		2001	15 December, 2001	94	6	878-883	878	883	English	print					The objective of our study was to evaluate the association between occupation and risk of liver cancer. A hospital-based case-control study was carried out during 1997-1999 in the Province of Brescia, a highly industrialized area in Northern Italy with a high incidence of this neoplasm. The cases were 144 male patients with incident liver cancer (96% hepatocellular carcinoma). Controls were 283 male patients, matched to cases on age (+-5 years), period and hospital of admission. Information on lifetime occupational history and alcohol consumption was obtained via interview. Specific occupational exposures to pesticides, solvents and other suspected hepatocarcinogens were evaluated. A blood sample was collected to detect hepatitis B and C infections. Odds ratios (OR) of occupational exposure and 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusted for age, residence, education, heavy alcohol intake, hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibodies positivity were computed. A statistically significant increased OR was observed for employment in repair of motor vehicles (OR 3.7; 95% CI 1.1-12.3; 9 exposed cases, 10 exposed controls). Increased ORs, although not statistically significant, were found for field-crop farm workers, food and beverage processors, blacksmiths and machine-tool operators, electrical fitters, clerical workers, manufacture of industrial machinery and personal and household services. A slightly increased OR was noted in workers exposed to toluene and xylene (OR 1.4; 95% CI 0.7-3.0, 23 cases, 36 controls); the OR was 2.8 (95% CI 1.0-7.6, 11 cases, 12 controls) for 20 or more years of exposure and 2.0 (95% CI 0.9-4.1, 21 cases, 28 controls) for 30 or more years of time since first exposure. The increase in OR seemed to be independent from that of alcohol or viral infections. Our study showed that the role of occupational exposures in liver carcinogenesis is limited. However, prolonged exposure to organic solvents such as toluene and xylene may represent a risk factor for liver cancer.

J		Article		Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) risk factors in sea-cultured Atlantic salmon Salmo salar		Jarp, J.; Karlsen, E.									Diseases of Aquatic Organisms		1997		28	2	79-86	79	86	English						A matched case-control study of infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) risk factors in Norwegian salmonid sea sites was performed in 1993. The distribution of potential exposure factors associated with the site management and location was compared in 2 paired groups of sea sites, one group comprising 37 ISA-positive sites and the other 37 ISA-negative sites. The risk of ISA was found to be significantly associated with the location of the site. Location within 5 km from a salmonid slaughterhouse gave an ISA odds ratio of 13.0 compared to location further away. The risk of infection increased by 8.0 if the site was situated closer than 5 km to another ISA-positive site as compared to the risk when the site was more than 5 km away. Disinfecting the waste water from the slaughtering and processing plants seemed to prevent transmission of ISA. The density of fish markets for sea-caught fish was higher in the vicinity of cases than of controls. The risk of ISA was associated with the number of hatcheries delivering smolt to the sea sites, and the risk increased if the hatcheries were located outside the site's home county. The overall results from the present study indicate that ISA is mainly transmitted from infected salmonid sources to clean sites through sea water. Further disease control measures should concentrate on minimizing the risk of transmission through sea water by shortening the time period between the diagnosis of ISA and the elimination of positive sites, and should work towards the establishment of 5 km as a minimum distance between sea sites. In addition, decontamination systems must be systematically introduced into the fish processing industry. The implementation of good sanitary practices by fish farmers may also reduce the risk of ISA.	Jarp, J.; Natl. Veterinary Inst., P.O.

Alan; Jarvie, Helen P.; Neal, Margaret; Hill, Linda; Wickham, Heather									Science of the Total Environment		2005	MAY 15 2005	344	1-3	107-128	107	128	English						Variations in phosphorus (P) concentrations in an agriculturally impacted river draining a Chalk aquifer and an associated canal in the west of the Thames Basin" southern England are examined and linked to agricultural and sewage sources and within river/canal process controls. The study area comprises the River Dun, the adjacent River Kennet and the Kennet and Avon (K&A) Canal. Large seasonal variations are observed for soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and dissolved silicon (Si) with low concentrations in the spring and summer times when biological activity is high. The K&A Canal shows the largest SRP and Si concentration declines. This reflects high biological activity coupled with higher temperatures and higher water residence times. The extent of SRP removal is examined in relation to organic (uptake/release with phytoplankton growth/decay) and, to a lesser extent, inorganic (SRP coprecipitation with calcite) mechanisms. Boron (B) is used as a tracer of sewage sources. Agricultural inputs of both dissolved and particulate P (PP) can be important particularly under conditions where the catchment is wet and near surface/overland flow is important: sewage treatment works effluent and septic tank discharges to groundwater also probably provide a major component of the SRP occurring within the water column. The canal, and to a lesser extent the river, acts as sink for P in sewage effluent sources due to the high biological activity especially during the spring and summer. The aquifer probably acts as a major sink for agricultural and septic tank inputs of P. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J		Article		Phosphorus forms and concentrations in leachate under four grassland soil types		Turner, Benjamin L.; Haygarth, Philip M.									Soil Science Society of America Journal		2000	May-June, 2000	64	3	1090-1099	1090	1099	English	print					The transfer of P in water draining from agricultural land can contribute to eutrophication and the growth of toxic algae. Traditionally, research has focused on particulate P transfer in surface pathways, with transfer by subsurface pathways perceived as negligible. We investigated this by monitoring P in leachate draining through large-scale monolith lysimeters (135 cm deep, 80 cm diam.) installed in a field site in southwest England. The lysimeters were taken from four grassland soil types with a range of textures (silty clay-sand) and extractable-P contents (15-75 mg kg-1 NaHCO3 extractable P) and leachate was sampled over two drainage seasons. Export of total P was <0.5 kg ha-1 yr-1 for all soil types. Concentrations of total P in the leachate routinely exceeded 100 mug L-1 and remained relatively stable throughout the drainage season, except during the late spring period when maximum concentrations >200 mug L-1 were detected from all soil types. Physically, most of the leachate P was dissolved (<0.45 mum), although 21 to 46% occurred in the particulate (>0.45 mum) size fraction, most notably from the sandy-textured soils. Chemically, the leachate was dominated by reactive (inorganic) P from all soil types (62-71%), although a large proportion was in unreactive (organic) P forms (29-38%). Reactive P occurred mainly in the <0.45 mum fraction, while unreactive P was predominantly in the >0.45 fraction. Unreactive P in the <0.45 mum fraction was greatest during the springtime (April-May), probably reflecting microbiological turnover and release of P in the soil. Our results indicate that (i) subsurface P transfer from soil to surface water can occur at concentrations that could cause eutrophication and (ii) unreactive and >0.45 mum P forms are important in subsurface P transfer.

J		Article		Soil respiration in an apple orchard		Blanke, Michael M.									Environmental and Experimental Botany		1996		36	3	339-348	339	348	English						To investigate why the largest CO-2 concentration occurred before sunrise at 0.6 m below an apple tree canopy, seasonal and diurnal fluctuations in soil and grass respiration were recorded in an apple orchard near Bonn, Germany between May 1994 and April 1995 with a portable, battery-driven infrared gas analyser and a soil respiration chamber. Respiration from soil on raised nursery beds with fresh organic matter was compared with herbicide treated, flat soil in tree rows and the grass between the rows to study the contribution of soil and grass respiration to the CO-2 balance of a fruit orchard. The following results were found. 1. Sod and grass respiration ranged from 0.18 to 24 mu-mol CO-2 m-2 s-1. 2. On cold winter days, with soil temperatures below 0 degree C, soil and grass respiration during the day remained below 0.6 mu-mol CO-2 m-2 s-1 and had the smallest diurnal variation. 3. The largest diurnal variations were in late spring with diurnal temperature differences of 15 degree C, resulting in respiratory values between 3 in the morning and 5-8 mu-mol CO-2 m-2 s-1 in the afternoon. 4.

J		Article		Effect of ecosystem structure and function of fish farming s simulated in littoral brackish water mesocosms		Lehtinen, K.-J.; Mattsson, K.; Tana, J.; Grotell, C.; Engstrom, C.									Aquaculture		1998	June 15, 1998	165	3-4	179-202	179	202	English	print					The effects of fish cage farming were simulated in littoral brackish water mesocosms. Two different dry fish feeds were used in the experiment, one commercially available feed and a purpose made feed containing 30% feral Baltic herring from the Archipelago Sea, SW Finland. Functional as well as structural effects of the fish farming simulation were obtained. The production limiting factor in the mesocosm appeared to be ammonium excreted by the fish. Excretion of nutrients was studied separately. Fish farming simulation initiated a successional development in the mesocosms in the form of higher sedimentation, higher sediment carbon content, a peak of BOD7 outflow, no or limited total organic carbon efflux and higher respiration as compared to the control over the experimental period. The functional effects coincided with higher sediment invertebrate biomass and abundance: the Baltic mussel, Macoma baltica and Chironomus plumosus were all favored by nutrient enrichment. Increased availability of ammonium also favored periphytic growth after an initial production peak of phytoplankton. Production of other than farmed fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) was doubled by biomass. Based on the separate fish nutrient excretion test, an eco-management model was put together. The results from this calculation imply that a 30% addition of feral herring in dry feed would result in a 1000 t yr-1 net removal of ammonium with a total fish production of 12000 t.

J	15093453	Article		Trout farm effluents: Characterization and impact on the receiving streams		Boaventura, Rui; Pedro, Ana M.; Coimbra, Joao; Lencastre, Eduardo									Environmental Pollution		1997		95	3	379-387	379	387	English						Effluents from three rainbow trout (Oncorhyncus mykiss) farms located in Northern Portugal were characterized and their impact on the receiving streams was evaluated. Mean fish productions in the studied fish farms were 15, 55 and 500 t of trout per year, respectively. The feeding water was abstracted from Fornelo, Inha and Coura Rivers, at flow rates ranging from 1.2 (15 t year-1 fish farm) to 4.8 litre s-1 per ton annual fish production (500 t year-1 fish farm). As the waterflows through the farms, net variations in the chemical characteristics were observed: a mean reduction in the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration between 0.7 and 2.4 mg litre-1; mean increases between 1.9 and 3.2 mg CaCO-3 litre-1 for total alkalinity, between 0.9 and 14 mg litre-1 for BOD-5, between 0.27 and 1.46 mg litre-1 for ammonia nitrogen (NH-4-N), between 0.060 and 0.579 mg litre-1 for soluble phosphorus (PO-4-P) and less than 16 mg litre-1 for suspended solids; variations in the pH value and nitrate nitrogen concentration were not statistically significant (p lt 0.05). At the 500 t year-1 fish farm it was also possible to detect net increases of total hardness (3.2 mg CaCO-3 litre-1), electric conductivity (19 mS cm-1) and permanganate value (3.6 mgO-2 litre-1). At the other farms net variations in these parameters were not significant. Net mass flow variations reported to the annual fish production are presented. The DO mass flow decreased, on average, between 255 and 549 g t-1 of fish per day. The mean daily BOD-5 increase ranged from 353 to 1510 g t-1 of fish. The corresponding ranges for the other parameters were 105-157 g t-1 for NH-4-N, 24-62 g t-1 for PO-4-P, 348-1035 g CaCO-3 t-1 for total alkalinity and 224 times 10-6-506 times 10-6 t-1 for mesophilic bacteria. Daily net variations of suspended solids, total hardness, electric conductivity and permanganate value were below 1753 g t-1, 342 g CaCO-3 t-1, 2081 mS cm t-1 and 392 gO-2 t-1, respectively. Longitudinal concentration profiles for the most relevant parameters show the impact of the effluent discharges on the physico-chemical and bacteriological river water quality downstream from the trout farms. Analyzing the situations from a purely chemical point of view, the polluted stretches were 3, 5 and 12 km long downstream from the effluent discharges, respectively. The microbiological contamination extended over longer distances.	Boaventura, Rui; Dep. Engenharia Quimica, Fac.

J		Article		The uptake and release of suspended and dissolved material by oysters and mussels in Marennes-Oleron Bay		Smaal, Aad C.; Zurburg, Wouter									Aquatic Living Resources		1997		10	1	23-30	23	30	English						The uptake and release of material by oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and mussels (Mytilus edulis) in Marennes-Oleron Bay (SW France) were measured in situ using benthic ecosystem tunnels (BEST). There was a large variation in seston concentrations, owing to high sedimentation/erosion dynamics. Organic matter was diluted by resuspended sediment, but had a low C/N ratio, i.e., a high quality, owing to resuspension of microphytobenthos. In many cases a significant decrease of chlorophyll concentrations was observed in tunnels with oysters and mussels. Average clearance rates per tidal cycle ranged from 4 to 7, and from 0.9 to 2.7 l cntdot g-1AFDW cntdot h-1 throughout the season, for oysters and mussels, respectively. Calculation of the filtration pressure (the fraction of the primary production filtered per day), indicated that bivalves in the bay were able to filter much more than the daily pelagic primary production. It seemed obvious that the bivalve stocks depended not only on phytoplankton but also on microphytobenthos. Significant regeneration of nitrogen could be demonstrated from musselbeds on the sediment, at higher rates than direct excretion of ammonium. No significant release of nutrients was observed for the oysters or mussels, when they were put on tables, as practiced by the oyster farmers. It seemed likely that biodeposits were flushed away from the tunnels in this case, and mineralization occurred elsewhere. It was concluded that the carrying capacity of the bay for herbivores is extensively exploited by the shellfish. Mineralization of bivalve biodeposits represent a large potential for nitrogen regeneration.	Smaal, Aad C.; Natl. Inst. Coastal and Marine Management/RIKZ, P.O.

Communications in Agricultural and Applied Biological Sciences		2003		68	4a	409-413	409	413	English	print					Simazine (2-chloro-4, his ethylamino-1,3,5-triazine) is a herbicide of the s-triazine group used mainly to control broad-leaved weeds in different crops. Several papers report about simazine and other s-triazine derivates as being actual polluting agents. In fact, simazine has been detected in groundwater and soil. Since this herbicide has been extensively used in Andalusia (south of Spain), we are analyzing the levels of simazine residues found in the soil of olive fields. We are also simazine could be detected isolating live micro organisms able to degrade this compound, and are characterizing the metabolic pathways leading to this degradation and the fate of this compound in nature. With all these data in mind, we will try to develop a strategy for the bioremediation of contaminated soils. We have taken samples of soil from many olive orchards of Andalusia that have been treated with simazine. These samples were located with the help of a handheld GPS. The presence of simazine of these samples was detected by HPLC. In most of the samples taken no, and those where it could be, contained very low levels of this herbicide (lower than 0.5 ppm). Soil samples are being characterized to determine their physicochemical characteristics (pH, organic matter, texture, etc), and we are attempting to correlate all these parameters with the presence or absence of simazine. From some of the soils, we have isolated a group of micro organisms that can grow using simazine as the sole carbon and nitrogen sources. We are analyzing how the addition of carbon or nitrogen can influence the rate of the simazine degradation.

J		Article		Histopathology and a real-time PCR assay for detection of Bonamia ostreae in Ostrea edulis cultured in western Canada		Marty, Gary D. (Gary.Marty@gov.bc.ca) ; Bower, Susan M.; Clarke, Kyle R.; Meyer, Gary; Lowe, Geoff; Osborn, Andrea L.; Chow, Eric P.; Hannah, Heather; Byrne, Sean; Sojonky, Ken; Robinson, John H.									Aquaculture		2006	NOV 16 2006	261	1	33-42	33	42	English						Bonamia ostreae is an intracellular haplosporidian parasite in European flat oysters Ostrea edulis that occurs on both coasts of the United States and causes significant mortality in Europe. Canada was considered free of B. ostreae until 2004, when it was first detected in O. edulis obtained for laboratory study from a western Canadian oyster farm. Bonamia ostreae was confirmed in O. edulis at the index farm in November 2004 using histopathology, conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, and sequencing of the PCR product. Archived samples of European flat oysters obtained from the index farm between 1999 and 2004 (n = 343) were re-examined and all samples collected before 2003 (n = 3 06) were confirmed negative for B. ostreae by histopathology (n = 3 06) and PCR (n = 62). In archived samples from 2003, B. ostreae was detected in 3 of 37 O. edulis by histopathology (n=2) and/or PCR (n=2). Also, records indicate that B. ostreae was not detected in O. edulis (n=348) from five other locations in western Canada between 1986 and 2000. To better understand the distribution and prevalence of B. ostreae in western Canada, 607 oysters from the index farm and 2 additional farms were sampled in the summer of 2005. All 3 farms had been stocked with 0. edulis spat from the State of Washington, USA, where B. ostreae is endemic. Samples were analyzed by histopathology and a new real-time PCR that amplifies a 68-bp target DNA fragment. B. ostreae was detected in all three locations, with prevalence ranging from 0.5 to 11.1%. Diagnostic sensitivity of the real-time PCR method was consistently greater than histopathology. Also, preliminary evidence supports the conclusion that real-time PCR on paraffin sections is more sensitive than histopathology; B. ostreae DNA was confirmed in 4 oysters by real-time PCR on paraffin-embedded tissues (and independently confirmed on unfixed tissues) that was not detected by histopathology. As a result of these findings, O. edulis spat are no longer allowed to be imported from endemic areas into Canada. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Allergy (Copenhagen)		2002	December 2002	57	12	1171-1179	1171	1179	English	print					Background: Studies in Europe have reported a reduced prevalence of allergy in farmers' children. We aimed to determine if there is a similar reduction in allergy among New Zealand farm children. Methods: Two hundred and ninety-three children participated (60%) aged 7-10 years, from selected schools in small towns and the surrounding rural area. Skin prick tests (SPT) to eight common allergens were performed. Parents completed questionnaires about allergic and infectious diseases, place of residence, exposure to animals, and diet, and they provided dust from the living-room floor. Endotoxin was measured using an Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) assay and Der p 1 using enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). Results: Current farm abode was found to increase the risk of having symptoms associated with allergy, but not SPT positivity. Independent inverse associations were found for early-life exposures: at least weekly consumption of yoghurt with hayfever (odds ratio (OR)=0.3, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.1-0.7) and allergic rhinitis (OR=0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.7); any unpasteurized milk consumption with atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome (AEDS) (OR=0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.8); cats inside or outside with hayfever (OR=0.4, 95% CI 0.1-1.0) and AEDS (OR=0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.8); dogs inside or outside with asthma (OR=0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.8); and pigs with SPT positivity (OR=0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.9). Conclusions: Despite finding a protective effect of early-life animal exposures, we found a greater prevalence of allergic disease on farms.

J	12389788	Article		The 20th century whole-basin trophic history of an inter-drumlin lake in an agricultural catchment.		Jordan, Philip (p.jordan@ulster.ac.uk) ; Rippey, Brian; Anderson, N. John									Science of the Total Environment		2002	7 October 2002	297	1-3	161-173	161	173	English	print					Eight 1-m sediment cores were extracted from across the basin of Friary Lough, a 5.4-ha eutrophic lake in a wholly grassland agricultural catchment in Co. Tyrone, Northern Ireland. Sedimentary TP, diatom inferred TP, Ca, Na, Fe, Mn, loss-on-ignition (LOI), dry weight and density were determined in the core profiles. Core dating and correlation gave a 210Pb, 137Cs and 241Am chronology from 1906 to 1995 and enabled a whole-basin estimate of chemical and sediment accumulation rate over the 20th Century. The major changes for all parameters occurred after c. 1946. Sediment accumulation rate was most influenced by organic matter accumulations, probably of planktonic origin, and increasing after c. 1946. Inorganic sediment accumulation rate was found to be largely unchanging through the century at 10 t km-2 yr-1 when expressed as catchment exports. All chemical accumulation rate changes occurred after c. 1946. Total phosphorus accumulation rate, however, was found to be the only chemical to be increasing throughout the epilimnion and hypolimnion areas of the sedimentary basin at an average of 22.5 mg m-2 yr-1 between 1946 and 1995. The other chemical parameters showed increasing accumulation rates after c. 1946 in the epilimnion part of the basin only. Interpreted in terms of whole-basin sedimentation and catchment export processes over time, it is suggested that diffuse TP inputs are independent of sediment inputs. This corresponds to hydrochemical models that suggest soluble P as the primary fraction that is lost from grassland catchments. The increase in sedimentary TP accumulation rate, and DI-TP concentration, are also explained with regard to current models that suggest increases in runoff P concentrations from elevated soil P concentrations. Increases in eplimnion chemical and sediment accumulation rate after c. 1946 may be due to local erosion that has limited impact on lake basin sedimentation.

J		Article		Developments in recirculation systems for Mediterranean fish species		Blancheton, Jean Paul									Aquacultural Engineering		2000	May, 2000	22	1-2	17-31	17	31	English	print					Nowadays, most European commercial hatcheries use recirculating water systems for all the different stages of Mediterranean fish rearing, from breeders to fingerlings several grams in weight. Despite a higher initial investment relative to flow-through systems, this technology reduces production costs mainly because much less energy is required for heating and the survival rate of the fingerlings is much higher. The introduction of recirculation systems has sped up the development of reliable and cost effective hatcheries. Commercial pre-growing units with recirculating systems are now used to produce fish weighing several tenths of a gram at the end of the cold season. This increases the productivity of cage structures, offers the possibility of introducing the fish into less sheltered areas, or may simply be an attempt to meet market demand in some countries. Fish farms are characterized by large rearing units, high stocking densities (more than 100 kg m-3), a large increase in biomass and long-term rearing. Several experimental size units (2-5 tons of annual production) have proved to be effective. Applying this technology to actual commercial farms (several hundred to several thousand tons) would require that the problem of drastically scaling-up all of the components of the rearing system be overcome. To achieve this, several companies are now involved with the French research institute Ifremer in the operation and evaluation of pilot commercial size production units (50-70 tons of annual production) financed by private investors, French public funds, and the European Economic Union. Two of these units, one situated in the south of France, the other in Iceland have now been built and the production of sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) has just begun. A third is under construction in the west of France (Brittany) and will be used for turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) production. The overall aim of these experiments is to provide data that will enable a model to be constructed that will describe, as far as possible, how each component of the recycling system works. p Based on this model, a more complete model will be constructed with which the optimal farm size can be determined, taking into account geographical, biological and economical parameters. In parallel, Ifremer is developing a research program in four main areas : (1) the influence of the rearing environment on fish; (2) the influence of fish on the rearing environment; (3) reducing the environmental impact of the farms, and (4) the optimization of the primary water treatment system, and its integrated management. The most promising foreseeable improvement in recirculating systems used for growing Mediterranean fish are: (1) an increase in mechanical filtration efficiency; (2) a better understanding of the standard optimal rearing medium parameters; (3) more information on the bacterial populations and how to control them, and (4) the incorporation and recycling of waste.

J	8921623	Article		Factors affecting the transfer of radiocaesium from soil to roe deer in forest ecosystems of southern Germany		Kiefer, P.; Proehl, G.; Mueller, H.; Lindner, G.; Drissner, J.; Zibold, G.									Science of the Total Environment		1996		192	1	49-61	49	61	English						Since 1987, in Southern Germany, as a consequence of the Chernobyl accident, the 137Cs activity concentration in roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) has been intensively monitored. A large data set is now available with approximately 5000 samples, with information about the location of the animal, the time of slaughtering, soil characteristics and distance to intensively managed agricultural land. Both the roe deer 137Cs activity concentrations and aggregated transfer coefficients soil-roe deer (T-ag,r) show a considerable variability with geometric mean and geometric standard deviation in meat of 270 cntdot 3.5+--1 Bq cntdot kg-1 and 0.01 cntdot 3.5+--1 m-2 cntdot kg-1, respectively. From 1987 to 1991, T-ag,r values exhibited a decline with an ecological half-life of about 3 years. Since 1991, no further decrease of the roe deer contamination level was observed. This general trend is superimposed by an increase in T-ag,r in autumn that has occurred in almost every year, which is probably due to consumption of mushrooms. This hypothesis is supported by a significant positive correlation between the precipitation during July and August, stimulating the fungi's growth and the height of the maximum in T-ag,r in autumn. Animals are less contaminated when living in parts of the forest from where they have access to intensively managed agricultural land. A small, but significant correlation is observed between the T-ag,r and soil parameters; the total potassium content of the soil and the pH of the organic soil layer. The highest transfer coefficients soil-roe deer were found on a peat bog, where most values ranged from 0.01-0.1 m-2 cntdot kg-1, and neither a pronounced seasonal variation, nor a long-term decrease was observed. On sites with coniferous forests, most T-ag,r values range from 0.005 to 0.05 m-2 cntdot kg-1, on sites with a mixture of coniferous and deciduous trees, the transfer coefficients range mostly from 0.002 to 0.02 m-2 cntdot kg-1. This is a further indication of the importance of the uppermost soil layers and the biological processes therein with respect to the bioavailability of caesium. On the two sites, the values at the lower boundary are more typical for animals that have access to agricultural areas, whereas the higher values were observed in autumn and for animals grazing distant from agricultural areas.

J		Article		Swedish botanical research under 1900 numbers	Svensk botanisk forskning under 1900-talet	Jonsell, Bengt (bengt.jonsell@tele2.se)									Svensk Botanisk Tidskrift		2007		101	1	19-54	19	54	Swedish						The background for the new research era that started with the 20th century was some major new theories that were introduced at the end of the 19th century: the insight about a glaciation, the influence of Darwinism and of the Mendelian laws. This survey is focused on research on Swedish vegetation and its history, on systematics in all plant groups Including fungi and lichens, as well as Swedish research In those fields in foreign countries. Excluded are plant physiology, as well as applied research in agriculture, forestry and nature conservation, Nor are treated disciplines budded off from botany (and zoology), such as genetics, limnology, and pollination biology.In vegetation history the most important names are Rutger Sernander in Uppsala and Gunnar Andersson in Stockholm who, with diverging opinions, envisaged the postglacial immigration of the flora. In the 1910s, Lennart von Post founded the pollen analysis of mires, which became the main tool for this type of research. Diatom analysis became Important with the works of Astrid Cleve-Euler. Taxonomic pollen research was founded by Gunnar Erdtman at his Palynological Laboratory in Stockholm.Vascular plant systematics was in the early 20th century focusing on variation In details of Linnaean species, and the distinguishing of elementary species. The study of apomictic groups played a major role. Embryological studies by Svante Murbeck in Lund on Alchemilla and Oscar Juel in Uppsala on Antennaria were principally important. Others distinguished microspecies in Hieracium, Taraxacum and up to the 1960s in the Ranunculus auricomus group. The reproductive peculiarities of the Rosa canino group were clarified by Gunnar Tackholm and Folke Fagerlind in Stockholm. Rubus was a major topic in Lund with Bengt Lidforss as the pioneer and after him Ake Gustafsson.In Lund, genecology was developed by Gote Turesson, who also conceived the ecotype concept. Institutions in S Sweden were pioneers in crop genetics with Herman Nilsson-Ehle as the leading figure, from whom genetics developed as a discipline of its own. Arne Muntzing, also in Lund, made in 1930 the first synthesis of a Linnaean species, Galeopsis tetrahit.Biogeographical problems, especially whether the Scandinavian mountain flora had survived the latest glaciation in situ, stimulated biosystematic research in genera such as Poa (J. A. Nannfeldt). In the 1950s to 1970s, biosystematics was undertaken in a substantial number of Swedish genera, and at Lund university a large programme for such research was carried out in Greece.Sweden had in the 19th century considerable research in the polar areas, which did not continue into the following century but for Carl Skottsberg in the Antarctic 1902-03, focusing on marine algae. Latin America saw a great number of Swedish botanists, taking advantage of the foundation by Anders Fredrik Regnell, which supported research travelling. This still goes on, in particular from Goteborg, where the Flora Ecuador is produced. South Africa was in focus for botanists in Lund from about 1930 (Henning Weimarck, Rolf Dahlgren and many more) and in tropical Africa, Olov Hedberg with his work in the mountains founded an active school that is still vigorous, resulting also in Floras of Ethiopia and Somalia. For the circumpolar areas, Eric Hulten has contributed major chorological works with extensive mapping of species, as well as Floras of Kamtchatka, Alaska and other areas.Phytogeography has been particularly active at Uppsala university, where Rutger Sernander was the pioneer, followed by G. Einar Du Rietz, who built up a phytosociological school that covered most types of Swedish vegetation. Particularly active was, and still is, research on mires, in which Hugo Sjors has played a prominent role. The research station at Abisko in the northernmost mountains is of great importance for vegetation studies. The island of Oland in the Baltic has also attracted many botanical scientists. Ecophysiological research, often in conflict with the Uppsala school, has taken place in Stockholm, while forests, both coniferous and deciduous, were in focus for research in Uppsala, Stockholm and Lund.Mycology has been an important field in Uppsala since the days of Elias Fries, In the 1930s to 1960s J. A. Nannfeldt led an active group there, especially focusing on ascomycetes. In Goteborg the study on Corticiales resulted from the 1960s in a major Flora. Lichenology has traditionally been strong in Sweden with Thore M. Fries as the leading name in the beginning of our century. Numerous theses were produced over the century with Gunnar Degelius and Rolf Santesson as leading names. Taxonomic bryology has been limited, while many plant geographical studies have been performed. In phycology, the 19th century pioneer was Carl Adolph Agarch, who founded the research on algae in Lund, which since then was for long an important centre for marine algae, and where limnology, thanks to the interest in plankton algae, budded off as an independent discipline in the 1920s.
